a) A divisional application is deemed filed on the filing date of the patent application
(A 76(1) EPC). Thus the deemed filing date of the divisional application is 12/2/01
Under A 86(1) EPC renewal fees are payable in respect of the third year and
each subsequent year calculated from the filing of the application. Under R. 37(1)
EPC renewal fees in respect of the coming year are to be paid on the last day of the
month containing the anniversary of the date of filing.
As the filing date of the divisional is 12/2/01 the patent years run as follows:
year 1
year 2
year 3
year 4
year 5
13/2/01
1 3/2/02
1 3/2/03
13/2/04
1 3/2/05
12/2/02
12/2/03
12/2/04
12/2/05
12/2/06
Under R. 37(3) EPC, renewal fees already due in respect of the earlier application
up to the date of filing of the divisional application must also be paid on the divisional
application.
Thus in 2004, the 3rd and 4th renewal fees must be paid.
b) Divisional application filed
= 29/1/04
= due date for 3rd year
Due date for year four = 29/2/04
1/3/04 R. 85(1)
Last day of 4 mo period for paying without an additional fee R. 37(3) for years 3 and
4 = 29/5/05
Under R. 37(3) EPC, renewal fees for a divisional application and any falling due
within a period of 4 months from the filing of the divisional may be paid within the 4
months without an additional fee
In this case the 3rd year fee is due on filing and the 4 y fee is due within 4 months
of filing, therefore both the 3rd and 4th renewal fees can be paid up until 29/5/04 (R.
which is extended to Monday, 31/5/04 under R. 85(1) EPC_
