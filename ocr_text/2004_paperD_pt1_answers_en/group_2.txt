Under R. 37(3) EPC) if payment is not made in due time, the renewal fees may
still be validly paid within 6 months of the due date, provided that the additional fee of
A 86(2) EPC) is paid within the 6 months as well.
For the 3rd year renewal fee, this 6 months falls due on 29/7/04 (Thursday).
For the 4th year renewal fee, this 6 months falls due on 31/8/04 (Tuesday) (i.e. 6
months from the end of Feb 2004 applying de ultimo ad ultimo under J 4(91)_
2) Under A 8 PCT, an international application may contain a declaration, claiming
the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in for any county party to the
Paris Convention (PC)_
Under A 66 EPC, an EP application which is accorded a date of filing is
equivalent to a national filing. Thus priority may be claimed from a European
application.
In the case the requirement that the priority claim be made within 12 months of
the date of filing of the first application has also been met (A 4C(1) PC)_
The problem in this case is the requirement of A 4C(2) PC for the priority claim to
be based on the first application; that is the application which first describes the
subject matter.
When EP FIRST was filed, the German utility model was in existence and had
rights outstanding therein. If it did not have outstanding rights then it would not have
gone on to publish. Thus the conditions of A 4C(4) PC are not met for basing the
priority claim on the later application.
In this regard it is important to not that under A 4 A (1) and (2) PC, a priority right
is established on the basis of a utility model.
This means that the priority claim in the PCT application is invalid; hence the
effective date for all the subject matter herein is the filing date, i.e. 23/9/03
This means that the public availability of the German utility model in Dec 2002 will
be available as full prior an against the PCT application A 33 PCT.

If only the opponent appealed the decision, then the patent proprietor is only a
party as of right to the proceedings (A 107 EPC).
In 99/92 it was held that if the opponent is the sole appellant, the patent proprietor
is restricted during Appeal to defending the patent in the form in which it was
maintained by the Opposition division. This is "Reformutio in pesusn. Thus generally
the patent proprietor will not be allowed to reinstate granted claim 1 _
