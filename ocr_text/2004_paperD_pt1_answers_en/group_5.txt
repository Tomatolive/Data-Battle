EP 1 â€”As the applicant indicated on F 1001 that he intended to pay the
designation fees for AT, BE, ES, DE and NL only, the applicant has waived his right
to a R. 85(a)(1) EPC communication in respect of all other states.
The deadline for paying the designation fees is 6 months from the date on which
the EPB mentions publication of the search report, i.e. 2/10/03 (A 79(2) EPC)_ On
this date the designation fees were timely paid for AT, BE, ES, DE
For NL, the applicant will receive a communication informing him that he has not
paid the designation fee (R 85(a)(1) EPC) and the deadline for paying it with a
surcharge is 1 month from the date of that notification.
For other states, no such notification will issue (see paragraph 1 above), thus the
deadline for paying the designation fees, along with a surcharge is set by R. 85(a)(2)
EPC and is 2 months from the missed deadline, i.e. 2/12/03
If both apply then any designation fee can be paid, with surcharge, up to the later
of the two dates (J 5/91). But both of these have passed. Thus in EP 1, only AT, BE
ES and DE can be designated.
EP 2 was filed prior to the deadline for paying the designation fees on EP 1 _ Hence
as Fl 001 contains a pre-checked box designating all contracting states, any
contracting state can be designated. G4/98 confirmed that the subsequent non-
payment of designations in the patent does not affect the designations on the already
filed divisional application.
EP 3 -This was filed after the deadline for paying the designation fees on EP
G4/98 confirmed that when no designation fee is paid by the expiry of the grace
periods of R. 85a that the designation is deemed withdrawn at the expiry of the
normal limit of A 79(2) EPC Thus when EP 3 was filed only the designations of AT,
BE, ES and DE were pending in EP 1 _ Hence under A 76(2) EPC only these states
(AT, BE, ES DE) can be designated in EP 3
