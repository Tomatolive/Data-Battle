The only way in which the patent proprietor would be allowed to make this
amendment would be if the patent as maintained in amended form would otherwise
have to be revoked as a direct consequence of an inadmissable amendment held
allowable by the opposition division (91/99).
In this case this seems unlikely since the amendment simply involved combining
claims; thus it is unlikely that the patent proprietor will be permitted to reinstate clam
1 as granted.

For the filing of an international application, the EPO is acting as a receiving office
under A 151(1) EPC Under R. 104(1) EPC, however, when the EPO acts as
receiving office, the international application shall be filed in French, German or
English.
Under R. 12.1 a) PCT, an international application shall be filed in any language
which the receiving office accepts for this purpose. This requirement is not met since
the application is filed in Spanish, and only French, German and English are
accepted (as stated above).
In this situation, R. 194 ii) PCT provides that if the international application is in
the wrong language, the application shall be considered to have been received by
that office (i.e. by the EPO) on behalf of the 1B as the receiving office.
Under R. 19.4 b) PCT, the EPO will promptly transmit the application to the 1B
and the international application so transmitted will be considered to have been
received by the 1B as receiving office on the date of receipt of the international
application by the EPO In this case this means that the filing date of 15/3/04, and
the priority claim, remains. The EPO may charge a transmittal fee for having done
this (R. 19.4 b) PCT)_
As the application has been transmitted to the 1B, the fees will now need to be
paid directly to it. Under R. 194 c) PCT. the deadline by which the fees (transmittal
fee, R 14.1 PCT, international fee, R. 15.1 PCT and search fee, R. 16.1 b) PCT)
must be paid is calculated from the date on which the international application is
actually received be the 1B, rather than the filing date. Thus these will be due 1
month from the date on which the 1B received the application.
Meanwhile, the EPO will refund the fees which were paid to it as these were paid
without legal basis. The only exception to this is that the EPO is entitled to keep an
amount equal to the transmittal fee for forwarding the application to the 1B (R. 19.4 b)
PCT).
