occurred 1 week before filing, but the compendium in writing was not available until
after filing Hence the professor's oral disclosure does not count as prior art
according to R. 64.2 PCT. Nevertheless the IPER shall call attention to the lecture.
b) Yes, under A 54(2) EPC, it is stated that the state of the art comprises eveMhing
made available to the public by means of written or oral description before the date
of filing of the application.
As the date of filing is the international filing date and the public lecture took place
before this date, it will be prior art for both novelty and inventive step under A 54(2)
and A 56 EPC_
10) No, I would not advise my client to file a Swiss national application and then try to
claim priority from it in a later EP application. I advise my client to file a European
application todayl
Under A 55(1) EPC, a disclosure of an invention shall not be taken into
consideration if it occurred no earlier than 6 months preceding the filing of the
European application if it has been displayed at an officially recognised international
exhibition.
93/98 confirmed that the calculation of the 6-month period is to the actual date of
filing of the European application, and the date of priority is not taken into account
when calculating this period.
Hence as the invention was first disclosed at the exhibition on 24/9/03, the 6
month deadline for filing the EP is today, 24/3/041 The application can be filed by fax
if necessary, R. 24 EPC
In order for the disclosure to be discounted it must be stated at the time of filing
the application that the invention has been so displayed so this should be done.
There is no remedy for not filing this statement
Moreover it will be necessary to file a supporting certificate within 4 months of the
filing of the application i.e. by 23/7/04 (Friday). This must be the certificate which was
issued at the exhibition by the authority responsible and state that the invention was
displayed there. The certificate must also state the opening date of the exhibition,
and as the opening date did not coincide with the first disclosure, the first date of
disclosure (i.e. 23/9/03). The certificate should also be accompanied by an
identification of the invention, duly authenticated.
