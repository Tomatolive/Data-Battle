N3 â€” this assumes that the exhibition is one which falls within the terms of the
convention in international exhibitions as set out in A 55(1) EPC If not, then the
exhibition will count as part of the state of the art under A 54(2) EPC
11) The R. 69(1) EPC communication dated 4/9/03 is deemed received on 14/9/03
(R. 782 EPC). Thus the deadline for requesting fufther processing, paying the fee
and completing the omitted act is 14/11/03 (A 121(2) EPC).
A121(1) EPC, however, states that the legal consequence of deemed withdrawal
following failure to reply to a time limit shall not ensure if the applicant requests
further processing.
According to R. 20(3) EPC, a transfer has effect vis a vis the EPO "only when" the
request for transfer is filed and a document satisfying the EPO that the transfer has
taken place have been produced. The wording "only when" in R. 22(3) EPC means
that the earlier date mentioned in the assignment is irrelevant for the EPO
Hence on the date on which the request for further processing was filed, as far as
the EPO is concerned, company A is the applicant, not company B. Hence the
request of company B for fulther processing is not valid as they are not the applicant
as required by A 121(1) EPC
