a) No, it is only possible to have the finding of the ISA as it the number of inventions
reviewed if the applicant pays additional search fees.
Under A 17.3 a) PCT. the ISA issues an invite to the Applicant to pay additional
search fees if it considers that more than one invention is claimed. R. 40 PCT sets
out the procedure for doing this and includes a protest procedure (R 402 c)- e)
PCT). This procedure provides for the lack of unity opinion held by the ISA to be
reviewed by a three membered Board.
However, R. 40.2 c) PCT specifically states that the additional fees may be paid
under protest Thus it does not allow for protest in the absence of payment of such
additional fees.
b) Under A 17.3 a) PCT, the non-payment of fees means that the international
search report will be established on those pans of the application which relate to the
invention first mentioned in the claims. The other subject-matter will remain
unsearched.
This means that the international preliminary examination will be restricted to
those pans of the application which have been searched. The international
preliminary examination report will state that this is the case (R. 70(0) PCT)_
It is important to note, however, that the non-payment of the additional search
fees does not meant hat the ISA or IPEA (or any of the designated offices) can
assume that the non-searched subject matter has been abandoned.

a) Under A 33(2) and (3) PCT, an invention claimed is considered novel and
inventive if it is not anticipated by the prior an as defined by the rules.
Rule 64 PCT defines for the purposes of A 33(2) and (3) PCT, what constitutes
prior art
Specifically, R. 641 b) PCT provides that where the making available to the
public occurred by an oral disclosure before the filing date of the application and the
date of the oral disclosure is indicated on a written document (in this case the
compendium) on a date later than the filing date, the non-written disclosure shall not
be considered as part of the state of the art for A 33(2) and (3). This applies in this
case since the oral disclosure making the claimed invention publically available
