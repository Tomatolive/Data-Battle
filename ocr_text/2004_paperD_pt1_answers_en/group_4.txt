a) Under A 75(1) b) EPC a European application may be filed at the central
industrial propeny office of a contracting state. Nat Law Book, table II confirms that
applications may be filed at INPI and that the application may be filed in any
language allowed under A 14(1) or (2) EPC
Under A 14(2) EPC a national of state which has a language other than English,
French or German may file the European application in an official language of that
state, even when they are resident abroad. Thus the Greek applicant living in Paris is
entitled to file the application in Greek, since Greek is the official language of
Greece.
However, A 14(2) EPC who provides that when an application has been filed in
such a language, a translation into one of the official languages must be provided A
14(1) EPC states that French, English and German are the official languages.
R. 6(1) EPC provides that the deadline for filing this translation is no later than 13
months after the date of priority. In this case this is by 13 March 2004, extended to
15 March 2004 under rule 85(1) EPC This deadline has passed. Thus the
application will be deemed withdrawn under A 90(3) EPC_
(i) The application can be re-flled, although it will not be possible to validly claim priority
from the earlier application of 13/2/03 as more that 12 months have now passed.
This will, however, only matter if there has been any relevant art published in the
intervening time.
(ii) He can use this application to claim priority from in a re-filed application if any new
subject matter was added in over the original priority application.
(iii) Apply for restitutio (A 122) of the deadline for filing the translation within 2 months of
removal of the cause for non-compliance (which in this case is likely to be a
notification under R. 69(1)), by requesting restitutio, paying the fee, filing the
translation, and setting out why despite all due care the deadline was missed.
