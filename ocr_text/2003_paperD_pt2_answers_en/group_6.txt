PP has EPI pending; plug with square contact looks patentable and when
granted could prevent LBP using, selling, making etc in any EPC state for
which designation fees are paid for, such plugs. Position with regard to
pentagon-shaped plugs is questionable - would need to show are
inventive; but presently still pending Once published EPI will provide
provisional protection (A 67 EPC), which can only be enforced after grant.
Maybe good idea to request early publication by EPO so that provisional
protection begins as soon as possible - need to file translations of claims in
those states requiring it.
PP is currently prevented from using etc. plugs with triangle or square
cross-section in Germany ES, FR and GB by EP2 (patents are negative
rights) Even though consider square x-section subject matter invalid is
presently still in force threat of filing opposition against this patent to get
this patent revoked centrally, at least with respect to the square contact
subject matter.
PP has ESI which can stop LBP operating in Spain with respect to Sl and
S2 type shields.
PP has PCT 1 pending, which could, if granted, prevent LBP operating
with Sl shield in any state in respect of which this is granted - possibly will
be EPC states and USA.
PP has EP4 pending (I think) which would prevent LBP exploiting S2 if
granted.
So, PP is in strong position as can, or may be able in the future, to prevent LBP
doing a number of things, especially in relation to the shielding systems. LBP may
not be so bothered about PP being able to stop some of their activities with the
plugs as they can freely use the A contacts evewwhere except US.
Looks possible to suggest cross-licensing so that LBP can use shields Sl + S2
and the A and z shaped contracts in US and shaped contact plugs in EPC
states where hopefully EPI will eventually grant In return, PP will want to be able
to use A shaped plugs.
If negotiation not successful,
oppose EP2, pay fee by 6. 8.03 using attacks described above in view of
EPI as A 54(3) EPC prior art for contact subject matter.
File A 115 EPC 3rd party observations against EP3, which is pending, in
view of PCT 1
Make sure enter PCT 1 in national phase and check fee payments on EP4.
Amend EPI by removing A subject matter, (divisional to pentagonal maybe) and
file request for accelerated prosecutiom Certainly request early publication of
EPI
