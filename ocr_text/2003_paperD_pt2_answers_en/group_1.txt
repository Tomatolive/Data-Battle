pp has:
LBP has.
IJS2
- granted in US (related to US 1)
EPI
- pending before EPO A + + for all states
FRI
- A France - still pending?
EP2 - granted for DE, ES, FR, GBA+
PP has granted US patent IJS2 which provides PP with patent protection for
HVHF plugs with triangular and square cross-sections in the US
EPI was sent by registered letter on 2010.02. In order to claim priority validly
from IJS2, EPI had to be filed during a period of twelve months from the date of
filing the first application, ie by 1 _ 1 1.02 (Friday), 1.11.02 was holiday in Munich
branch of EPO so under R 85(1) EPC, due date for claiming priority was
extended to Monday 411.02. EP 1 was not received at EPO until & 11.02, ie after
the due date. But R 48a EPC provides that where a document is received late at
the EPO it is deemed to have been received in time if it was posted in due time
before the expiry of the time limit Dec. of Pres. OJ 1999, 45 and E - VIII, 1.7 sets
out that document must be posted at least 5 days before due date and it can be
sent by registered letter or recognised delivery service and if from outside Europe
by air mail. Here, EPI was posted 6 days prior to due date by registered letter
and from inside Europe Therefore, EP 1 is deemed received in due time to claim
priority from IJS2_ However EP 1 may only claim priority in respect of the same
invention as in US2, which is the first application and in the preceding 12 months.
"Same invention" (G 2/98) means that the specific combination of features in the
claims of EPI must be disclosed in the first application as a whole either explicitly
or implicitly. For the clams to the plug with square contacts, EPI can validly claim
priority from IJS2, since the first application by the same applicant in which this
subject matter was disclosed was US2_ However, for claims of EPI relating to A
contacts, IJS2 was not the first application in the sense of A 87(1) EPC The
subject matter of the triangular contacts was disclosed in a still earlier application
(USI) originating from PPI so the priority right for the plugs with triangular
contacts is invalid in so far as this was already described in USI since the A 87(4)
EPC exception doesn't apply in this case (cascading priority problem here), ie
although the previous (USI ) and subsequent (US2) applications were filed in the
same state (USA), at the filing date of IJS2, USI had not been withdrawn,
abandoned or refused (as it was withdrawn after IJS2 filing date) and it had left
rights outstanding (in that US2 is a C-I-P of USI)_ Therefore, the 3 areas of
subject matter of EPI do not have the same effective date (A 89 EPC).
Square contacts - entitled to priority date (ie filing date of US2) of 1.11.01
Triangular contacts and new pentagon contacts entitled to filing date only.
The date on which all the requirements for a filing date were met (A 80 EPC) was
-6
