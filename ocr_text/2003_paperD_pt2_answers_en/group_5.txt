notification under R 85a(1) if didn't dispense with notification and within 2 M of
missed date if did dispense with designation, R 85a(2) EPC). All these dates will
likely have passed now (certainly R 85a(2) EPC deadline would have) and no
further processing or restitutio possible on these time limits. So check paid - if not
cant do anything with EP4 now so claims to S2 would have been deemed
withdrawn. If these fees etc. were paid then EP4 still pending and make sure pay
3rd year renewal fee due 3110.03 (can be paid up to 304.04 with additional fee,
A 86(1) + (2) EPC)_
If EP4 still pending, can't amend EP4 to put in claims to Sl (which would have
saved having to enter PCT 1 in European regional phase) even though have
description of SI in EP4's abstract as abstract may not be used for providing
support for amendments (T 246/86). Consequently such an amendment would
not be allowable since it would add matter over the application as originally filed
(contrary to A 123(2) EPC). Also, a priority document (ie here ESI) can not be
used as basis for an amendment (also G 3/89 relevant). Therefore, if want to
protect Sl in Europe, will have to continue with PCT 1 (likewise, can't amend PCT
1 by including clams to S2 since disclosure of S2 in PCT 1 is only in abstract). If
EP4 is still pending (and designation fees paid) then it is also relevant as novelty
only prior art against EP3 to the extent that designate same states and that
designation fees have been paid and because EP4 has an effective date earlier
than but was published later than effective date of EP3_
However, although EP4 discloses Sl in the abstract, even such a disclosure was
enabling, since EP4 is relevant to EP3 for novelty only, content of abstract cannot
be taken into consideration (since A 54(3) EPC refers to content of application as
filed and neither pror document nor abstract, in view of A 85 EPC, form part of
content of application). Abstract only forms part of prior art once published.
Therefore, EP4 would not affect novelty of subject matter claimed in EP3
ESI - Spanish right now granted So, PP can stop anyone making, using etc.
both Sl and S2 type shields in Spain.
ESI is relevant to EP3 as a prior national right - could lead to revocation of EP3 if
granted, with respect to Spaim (Check when published though - assuming not
published by 15.301 filing date of EP3 - if did then ESI would be full prior art).
But as prior national right, ESI can't affect EP3 until after grant as is not
considered comprised in the state of the art for EP3_ Also, can't oppose EP3, if
granted, before EPO in view of ESI itself as prior national right is not a ground of
opposition.
Negotiation position
pp's position
PP has granted US2 in US, so can prevent LBP from using, selling,
making etc (and any other acts constituting infringement under US law)
plugs with triangular or square-shaped contacts in the US, which is a
relevant market for LBP. -4 ie bargaining point for PP. (Patents are
negative rights).
