At least exam fee and request have been dealt with through (due also 6 M from
publication of search repoll) as first examination report has already issued. PCT 1
- although no action since search report published, this application is still pending.
Seems that no Demand for international prelimnary examination was filed in
accordance with A 31 PCT) but since filing of Demand is no longer necessary to
extend entry into national phase from 20/21 M to 30/31 M in all states, this
application is still pending for all states except those that have notified the 1B of
the non-applicability of the new time limit under A 22(1) PCT, presently including
Brazil, Singapore and others. However US and EPO have applied new A 22(1)
PCT time limit. So, for all those countries that have applied the new time limit 30
M period from priority date for entering national/regional phase for PCT 1 expires
14.03 - this is the case for the USA 31 M period expires 1_5.03 - eg for EPO
So, if want protection in USA and Europe, enter national phase in US by 1_4.03
need to file translation of Spanish application into English and pay national fee,
file declaration of inventor, declaration of applicant's entitlement to priority and
preferably Information disclosure statement by the expiry of 30 M deadline (ie
14.03) Must at least pay national basic fee by this date but other requirements
can be met later, if necessary on payment of various surcharges.
Have a little more time for EPO ento,' (1.5_03). Need to pay national basic fee, pay
designation fees, pay search fee, file request for examination and pay
examination fee, and pay 3rd year renewal fee on this application by 31 M due
date (R 107(1 ) EPC), grace periods available for these acts on payment of
surcharges (R 108 EPC). Also required (R 107(1 )(a) EPC) to file translation of the
application, which is presently in Spanish, into one of the official EPO languages
(FR, DE, EN).
Since all states were designated and paid for in PCT 1, may wish to consider
whether want to obtain protection for Sl in other states (apart from those that
have notified non-applicability of A 22(1) PCT).
Once requirements for entry into European phase have been fulfilled (A 158 EPC,
R 106 and R 107 EPC), PCl 1, which has an effective date of 110.00 since it
appears to have validly claimed priority from ESI (same applicant within 12 M
from ESI filing date, same subject matter - ie Sl shield) will be A 54(3) EPC prior
art with respect to EP3 (ie novelty only prior art). This is because PCT 1 has an
effective date prior to the effective date of EP3 (which does not have a claim to
priority) but PCT 1 published (on 104.02) after the effective date of EP3_
Therefore, to the extent that PCT 1 and EP3 designate the same states (A 54(4)
EPC) and the designation fees for PCT 1 are pad, the subject matter of the
claims of EP3 (SI type shielding system) lack novelty over the disclosure of PCT
1 (which also discloses the SI type shielding system).
EP4
This is already European patent application, nothing appears to have happened
since publication of search report (104.02). Check designation fees and exam
request and exam fee was paid/filed by 10.10_02, or within R 85a or b EPC grace
periods (for exam fee within 1 M from notification of the failure to observe the time
limit and surcharge payable, R 85b EPC; for designation fees 1 M after
