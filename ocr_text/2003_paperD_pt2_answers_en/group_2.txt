R 84a EPC does not apply to filing date itself as was no "due date" missed.
So, effective date for A and contacts subject matter is 08.11.02.
EP2 claims priority from FRI FRI discloses plugs with triangular contacts only.
EP2 validly claims priority from FRI since they have same applicants (LBP) and
EP2 was filed within 12 months of FRI's filing date, but only in respect to the
same subject matter. Therefore subject matter in EP2 relating to plugs with
triangle contacts has valid claim to priority of 6.6.01 _ But subject matter in EP2
relating to plugs with square contacts is entitled only to the filing date of EP2, ie
This means for:
(i) square contact subject matter in EPII which has effective date of 1.11.02, EP2
is not prior art since the square contact subject matter in EP2 has an effective
date of 14.11.01 _ In fact, EPI is prior art for novelty only (under A 54(3) and (4)
EPC) - not inventive step - against the square contact subject matter in EP2 as
EPI has an earlier effective date than EP2 but will be published after the filing
date of EP2, in respect of the states that are designated in both applications and
only if EPI publishes as a regularly published application under A 93 EPC and
the designation fees for EPI are paid (R 23a EPC).
EPI is not due to be published until after 18 months from priority date, so 18
months from 111.01 , ie due to be published soon after 1_5.03_ Designation fees
are due (and examination fee and request for examination) within 6 months of
publication of search report (and R 85a grace periods apply), which will either be
published at same time as application or later. So PP need to make sure this is
done in order that EPI is A 54(3) EPC prior art against EP2 for square subject
matter.
(ii) for triangular subject matter in EPI , effective date is 8.11.02 (actual filing date)
so EP2, which has then published, is full prior an for novelty and inventive step (A
54(2) EPC) against this application. A subject matter of EPI looks like it lacks
novelty over EP2
(iii) for pentagon subject matter in EPII effective date is & 11.02, ie actual filing
date. EP2 is full prior art as explained above. EP2 does not disclose plugs with
pentagon contacts so EP2 does not give rise to lack of novelty of subject matter
of EPI_ Issue is inventive step: Is a pentagon-shaped contact obvious in view of a
triangular or square shaped contact, as disclosed in EP2. From client letter
seems that pentagon shape is equivalent solution to triangle and square shape
so may be difficult to argue that this subject matter has an inventive step over
EP2.
Also be to checked, is there a US patent application publication? there should be
as USI and US2 were filed after the 2011.00 date at which publication of US
applications took effect. USI was withdrawn so wouldn't have published IJS2
would have published - but not sure if date is 18 M from filing date of IJS2 or 18 M
