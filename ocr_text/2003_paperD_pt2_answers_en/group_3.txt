from filing date of USI which was basis for the IP - does not appear to affect
situation With respect to EPI or EP2 though.
Also relevant to patent situation for EPI , EPC does not consider aesthetic
creations as such to be patentable (A 52(2)(b) and (3) EPC). Shape of contact
aesthetic creation? Appears not as has technical effect, therefore at least the
square contact subject matter of EPI appears patentable.
For pentagon-shaped contact, if changing shape from square (as disclosed in
EP2) to pentagon only provides equivalent effect, then the issue of is this merely
an aesthetic creation may also be relevant as the change in shape does not
provide a technical effect, therefore pentagon subject matter may be
unpatentable
On unity point, in absence of EP2 from consideration, the three embodiments
have corresponding special technical features which are alternatives having the
same technical effect and so are unified, C-lll, 7.2, R 30(1) EPC Further problem
perhaps is presence of multiple independent clams to the plug with each type of
contact shape in view of new R 29(2) EPC which sets out specific exclusions to
general requirement that there may be only one claim type (ie product or process)
in each European patent application. R EPC exclusion is that the claims
are alternative solutions to a panicular problem, where it is not appropriate to
cover these alternatives by a single claim. That is the case here - the 3 shapes
are alternative solutions to the problem of prolonging life of the HVHF plugs. So,
feel could argue in theory' for the presence of such independent claims in EPI (if
not then could file divisional applications at any time while patent still pending).
However, due to EP2 making triangular contact shape subject matter lacking in
novelty, at least that independent claim may have to be removed from EPI
Note that EP2 had mention of grant published on 6.11.02, so still in opposition
period. Could file an opposition against EP2 up to g months from 6.11.02, ie up to
6.803 (and pay fee). Presence of EPI as A 54(3) novelty only citation could be
used as ground of opposition, A 100(a) EPC against square-contact subject
matter.
May be worth requesting accelerated prosecution of EPI

EP3 has no priority claim. Publication of search report mentioned 248.02.
Therefore, designation fees, due 6 M from 24.9.02, ie 24.3_03 (Monday). This fee
is still payable with surcharge in the grace period of R 85a EPC But check
whether these have been paid, if not paid by end of grace period application will
be deemed withdrawn (A 91(4) EPC).
