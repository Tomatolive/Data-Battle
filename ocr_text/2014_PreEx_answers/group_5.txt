Question 13
The subject matter of claim II reads on a liquid soap dispenser with a portion of the tube
touching the base of the bottle as in the first embodiment (statement 131) and as in D2
(statement 13.3).

claim II is limited to contain a liquid in general.
The tube 430 of D4 is parallel to the base of the bottle, but does not extend along the base
of the bottle
