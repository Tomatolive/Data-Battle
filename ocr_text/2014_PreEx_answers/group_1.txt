Question 1
Further processing is excluded in respect of the period under Rule 64 EPC for paying an
additional search fee, Article 121(4) EPC and Rule 135(2) EPC In order to pursue the
second invention, the valid options include the following:
1) since you have not taken any action, the application is pending (and not withdrawn).
You can file a European divisional application to EP-A (Article 76(1) EPC and
Rule 36 EPC);
2) since the priority period has not yet expired (Article 87(1) EPC), you can file a European
patent application EP-B claiming priority from EP-A;
3) since the priority period has not yet expired (Article 8(2)(a) PCT and Article 4 C (1) of
the Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property), you
can also file an international application PCT-B claiming priority from EP-A.
1.1 - False
1.2 - True
1.3 - True
1.4 - True
Question 2
The European divisional application EP-D can be validly filed as long as the earlier
application (in this case EP-P) is pending, Rule 36(1 ) EPC. EP-D has to be filed before the
time limit of twenty-four months for filing a divisional application to EP-P has expired. This
time limit is triggered by the first communication under Article 94(3) EPC in respect of
EP-P, Rule 36(1)(a) EPC as entered into force on 26 October 2010. Even if EP-D contains
subject-matter extending beyond the content of the earlier application as originally filed, it
cannot be converted into an independent application taking 6 December 2013 as its date
of filing (Guidelines C-IX, or GI /05, Reasons 11 .1). Consequently, EP-P cannot be
prior art for EP-D. Although no renewal fee was due in respect of EP-P when EP-D was
filed, this fee for EP-P became due on 31 December 2013. The renewal fee due in respect
of EP-P shall be also paid for EP-D, Rule 51 second sentence, EPC This fee can be
paid within four months from filing without an additional fee, i.e. on 7 April 2014
[6 December 2013 + 4 months (= 6 April 2014), extended to Monday 7 April 2014],
Rule 51 (3) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 134(1) EPC)]_
