the notice of appeal begins on the 17.02.1995 (date Of dispatch plus 10 days (Rule 78(3)) and
ends On the 17.041995, Easter Monday, but is further extended to the 18.04.1995 (Rule 85(1).

Amended claims which conform with what the examiner has indicated as being allowable should
be filed with the grounds of appeal- The examining division should then take advantage of the
provision for Interlocutory Revision (Art. 109 EPC), and provided it regards the appeal to be
admissible and well founded (i.e. overcoming the previous objections), the decision to refuse the
application will be reversed (Art. 109 EPC).
Regarding the issue of fees, the first renewal fee was due on 3101.1995 (last day of month in
which second anniversary of filing date falls (Rule 37(1 in accordance with Art 86(1 ) EPC and
is now overdue. The renewal fee may still be validly paid within six months of this date provided
that a 10% surcharge is paid at the same time (Art 86(2)). The renewal fee should therefore be
paid before the 31.07.1995.
