According to Enlarged Board of Appeal decision GI/92, the chemical composition Of a product
belongs to the state Of the art when the product as such is available to the public and can be
analysed and reproduced without undue burden by the skilled person, irrespective of whether or
not particular reasons can be identified for analysing the composition. Since the product Y in
question was freely available ("sold without restriction"), it was available to the public, and could
have been analysed by the skilled person. The issue of whether Company C actually made an
analysis of the product Y or not has no relevance - it is only important that an analysis could
have been made without undue burden. Therefore product Y does belong to the state of the art
with respect to the opposed patent.
(i) In the case where the pnority period has not yet expired, the applicant should file the
omitted sheet containing figure 2 before the priority period expires. In accordance with
Art. 91 (6) the applicant should request that the application be re-datcd to the date of receipt
Of figure 2 (provided this is within the priority period). If the applicant does not request a
re-date himself, the Receiving Section will set a One month term for the applicant to request
a re-date. The applicant should not wait until receiving notification from the Receiving
Section under Rule 43(2) that a figure is missing, since by then the priority period will
probably have expired and the application would have to be re-dated to the date (after the
priority date) on which the omitted figure was filed. Alternatively the applicant could file
a new application within the priority period including the previously omitted figure 2. Since
no fees have been paid on the original application EPI it can be left to be deemed to have
been withdrawn.
(ii) In the case where the priority period has already expired, the applicant must decide whether
he considers the inclusion Of the omitted figure 2 more important that the loss of the priority
claim. If he does, the omitted sheet should be filed With the EPO with the least possible
delay (e.g. fax), and according to Art. 91(6) a request made for the application to be re-dated
to the date of receipt of figure 2. If the priority claim is regarded as more important, then
figure 2 will have to be abandoned and any references to figure 2 will be deemed to be
deleted (Art. 91(6). A compromise solution could be to maintain the original application with
the priority claim but without figure 2 and to file a new application straightaway without the
priority but including figure 2.
N.B. The omitted drawing cannot be corrected under Rule 88 since there is no way Of telling
exactly what the applicant intended to be included in figure 2.
(i) The designation of inventor(s) should be filed with the application, according to Art. 81 and
Rule 17 EPC_ Art. 91 (10 stipulates that the Receiving Section examines whether the
