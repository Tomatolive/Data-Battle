QuesfQn_9
Ireland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Switzerland are Contracting States to the convention; an
Extension Agreement is in effect for Slovenia. No provision exists for such an Extension
Agreement with Croatia. It is therefore possible to obtain patent protection by an EP application
in all the above States except Croatia.
The countnes which are Contracting States should be designated with the filing Of the
application. According to Art. 79(2), the designation fees must be paid within twelve months of
filing Of the application or the priority date, if priority is claimed. In the latter case, the time-limit
for payment is extended to one month after the date Of filing of the application if this is later in
accordance with Art. 78(2)EPC If the Contracting States have been explicitly designated then
a I month period of grace from the Rule 85a(l) notification is provided within which the fees
can be paid with a 50% surcharge. If an explicit designation has not been made, the Rule 85a(l)
is dispensed with and the provision of Rule 85a(2) provides for a grace period of two months
within which the fees can be paid with a surcharge
As far as Slovenia is concerned it too can be designated at the time of filing, the extension fee
to cover this extra designation being payable within the same time-limlts that apply for the other
designations. The Rule 85a(2) grace period of two months with a 50% surcharge is applicable
The designation fee for each State is DM 350, except for Switzerland and Liechtenstein, for
which a joint designation fee Of DM 350 is payable.
