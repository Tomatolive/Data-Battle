requirements are to be filed within the two month time-limit, which in this case is later than the
1 year period. Since the grounds were filed before 17.10.1994, the request for re-establishment
is admissible.
The Protocol on Recognition governs the competence of national courts in relation to decisions
over claims against the applicant to the entitlement to the grant of a European patent. The
answers given below are all provisional on the absence of any agreement in accordance with
Art 5 of the Protocol on Recognition.
(i) According to the above Protocol, Art. 4, if the claimant is an employee Of the applicant, then
Art. 60(1) EPC applies. According to this article 60(1), when determining who has the right
to the European patent, if the inventor is an employee the law of the state in which an
employee is mainly employed applies. Therefore the inventor should open proceedings in
A ustria.
(ii) If the inventor is not an employee, the applicant has his residence or principal place Of
business outside the Contracting States, and the claimant has his residence of principal place
Of business within one of the Contracting States, then the courts of that State have
jurisdiction (Protocol on Recognition Art. 3). The inventor should therefore open proceedings
in Belgium
(iii) In this case neither the claimant nor the applicant have their residence or principal place of
business within one of the Contracung States, therefore, according to Art. 6 Of the above
Protocol, the courts of the Federal Republic of Germany have jurisdiction. The inventor
should therefore open proceedings in Germany.
Question 5
(i) According to Art. 2(vi), 8(1) and PCT and Art 66 EPC, an international application
may claim a priority of one or more earlier national or regional applications filed in or for
any country party to the Paris Convention. A European application accorded a date of filing
is, in the designated States, equivalent to a regular national filing; it is considered as
regularly filed for that State and can give rise to a priority right Therefore an international
application may validly claim the priority of a European application and designate the same
States as the earlier application
(ii) There is no specific provision in the EPC against double patenting. However, if the provision
of Art. 125 is applied, then in line with the patent systems of the Contracting States the
general principle is that two patents should not be granted to the same applicant for the same
invention (see Guidelines C IV 6 4). According to the Guidelines, the applicant should be
requested to amend the applications so that there is some difference in the claimed
Inventions.

applications claiming the same subject-matter were to be granted, it would be a matter for
