Model Solution to Paper 1)/1995
According to Rule 48(2), a European patent application shall not be published if it is withdrawn
before the termination Of the technical preparations for publication. Rule 48(1) States that
President of the EPO shall determine when technical preparations are deemed to have been
completed. In the declsion of the EPO President dated 14.12.1992, it is stated that these
preparations are considered terminated at the end of the day that comes seven weeks before
expiry Of the eighteen month period from the date of filing or priority.
Hence in this case, since the applicant notified the EPO nine weeks before the expiry Of the
eighteen month period, he can be sure that the application will not be published.

(i) Since the EPO is closed for Easter between 14 and 17 April, according to Rule 85(1), the
time limit is extended to the first day upon which all filing offices are open for the receipt
of documents and on which ordinary mail is received i.e. 18 April. Therefore the
representative can refile the application on the 18 April (which is still within the time limit)
Claaming the priority Of 14 April 1994, and leave the original application to be deemed to
have been withdrawn, as no fees have yet been paid.
The alternative would be to add the priority data to the request for grant form, as a
correction under Rule 88 EPC, first sentence, and it would not be necessary to prove that
any mistake had been made (see Legal Board Of Appeal Decision J9/91).
(ii) If the representative had only realised his mistake on 19 April, the first option above would
not have been possible, since the time limit would have expired. The second option would
be the only one remaining.
The Rule 69(1) EPC notification regarding the ensuing loss of rights was sent out by the EPO
on the 0508.1994. According to Rule 78(1) EPC this notification would have been made by
registered letter, and was deemed to have been received by the representative on the 15.08.1994
(Rule 78(3)). The receipt of this notification Constltutes a removal of the cause of non-compliance
within the meaning of Art. 122(2)EPC. Therefore the representative has 2 months from the date
of receipt of the Rule 69(1) notification in which to file an application for restitut10 in integrum
(Art. 122). The two month period actually expires on the 17.10.1994 (Rule 85(1) EPC). The
omitted act itself (the payment of the renewal fees) must also be completed within this period.
According to Legal Board of Appeal decision J6/90, it is enough that the filing of an application
for restitutio is completed within I year of expiry of the unobserved time-limit (i.e. 30.09.1994)
(Art. 122(2)). The request for Restltutio in Integrum was received by the EPO on 21.09.1994 and
the payment of the renewal fees on the 28.09.1994, i.e. both before 30.09.1994. Theother Art 122
