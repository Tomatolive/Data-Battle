A European patent application, designating BE, CHILI, FR, GB, GR, IT and SE was filed by
company A on 31 August 1988 without claiming priority. The application resulted soon
afterwards in the successful negotiation Of a royalty-bearing licence wit) company B. The
contract provided for company A to repay the royalties paid in respect of any designated state
in which the patent was not brought into force or was invalidated. Royalties were duly paid by
company B. The grant Of the patent was published on 5 July 1995.
In January 1996, company B wrote to company A, refusing to make payment for the royalties
due for 1995, citing a document published in 1986 which they had just found and which they
believed clearly anticipated the subject matter of the patent. Company A has not yet replied but
on investigation you (company B's patent attorney) find that none Of the renewal fees due in
August 1995 have been paid.
Advise Company B on the question Of recovery Of royalties.
