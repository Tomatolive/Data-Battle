No — the corrununication under R. 51 (4) should include the text

However, if the prior art is of extreme relevance, i t should
be notified to the EPO, and they should consider re—opening
examination. If this newly found patent application is of such
relevance, then, during re—examinaeion a reference to i t could
be introduced. If it i s not of such relevance to re—open
proceedings a mention of it in the application can not be
essential .

NO — programs for computers are speciEica11y excluded
under Art. 52 (2) To qua li fy for patentability as, for
example, a computer operated by the program, there must
be some technical progress. Translation of one language
Co another — i.e. the Of the program, or the
effect Of the program, can not be considered a technical
effect, and would itself be excluded as a •method for
pertorming mental aces • under Art. 52 (2) (c) . There is
much Board Of Appeal case law on computer and mental
aces.
Methods of treatment of hurnan are excluded from
patentability under Art. 52 (4) .
However, a method of treatment is a method of surgery or
therapy, including curative or prophylactic therapy.
A sun—tanning pili might be considered a cosmetic
treatment and may well have patentability because Of its
sole cosmetic indication. European case law has indicated
that cosmetic treatments are patentable.
I would recorrunend claiming the tablet per se if new, or
the use of the tablet in cosmetic treatment, rather than
a method of treatment claim format .
It Should be considered whether Such a compound would be
excluded under Art. 53 i.e. as being contrary to
ordre public and moral i Ey. Clearly, use Ot the cornpound
would not be legal in that the police breath test would
be ineffective. However, if some alternative use for the
compound could be found it may then be patentable. (The
Guidelines give Some examples here e . g. the let ter bornb
which is Clear Iy not patentable — but a safe—breaking
mechanism which may have alternative, i.e. non-burglaty
related uses may be patentable) .
If the only use Of the compound is an illegal use, then
the compound Should not be patentable under Art. 53 (a) .
If there is some alternate use, as well as the illegal
use, patentability cannot be denied — if all other
patentability requirements are fulfilled.
