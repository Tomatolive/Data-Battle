The error: applicant considers that this is an error Of the
EPO. However, care Should be taken on this front. There was
clearly an error in that the applicant • s reference was
incorrect Iy stated — and this error was made at the EPO.
However, the EPO assigned application nurùer was correct — and
presumably also the ti tle of the invention, if given. Although
there is no case law on this point, reference could be made to
case law on opposition proceedings —
for exarnple an opposition
is deemed allowable if sufficient information is given to
identify the application in question, even if the requirements
Of the EPC are not fully met. In the present situation one
could Say that sufficient information was given by the EPO to
identify the application — in the application number.
There is therefore possibility Of blaming the error on
the EPO SO that recovery Of the application could be made that
way. There i s also no provision e.g. under R. 89 or R. 82, in
Che EPC for correction of errors in EPO .
The applicant Cannat apply Art. 121 further processing,
because the 2 month time limit Set by Art. 121 (2) has passed.
He also cannot apply for a decision under R. 69 (2) , because
the 2 month time limit for this runs concurrently with that
for further processing and has thus expired. The only option
available is Art. 122 restitutio.
Requirements are :
missing Of the time resulted in loss Of rights;
(i i) omitted act and request for restitutio must be filed
wit:hin 2 rwnths of removal of the cause of non-
compliance with the time limit (Art. 122 ;
(iii) payment of fee;
(i v) proof that all due care required by the circumstances
was taken.
Applicant should therefore file his request irrmediately and
within 2 months of the refund of the renewal fee.
Chances of success? Because he files many applications it
miqht be that the mix-up was an isolated mistake Of procedure
in a norma Ily satisfactory system. European case law confirms
that in such situations restitutio may be al Iowed.
French is the language of the proceedings of the patent
application — this is the language in which the application
was fi led - Art. 14 (3) .
Opposition may be fi led in any EPO official lanquage, under
R. 1 (1) . English is therefore al right as the language Of the
oppos t ion.
Documents to be used as evidence may be fi led in any language
under R. 1
in English.
Under R. 2 (4) -
if the parties
The US firm may therefore file such documents
any language may be used at oral proceedings
and the EPO agree. However, R. 2 (1) States that
