c)
Because EP—I is the second disclosure Of this
information, i t cannot serve as a priori ty document
alone .
If EP-I was fil ed claiming priori ty from DE and then DE
was abandoned, the fact that DE was the first disclosure
of the information and not EP-I does not change and the
situation as under (b) above would still .
For EP—I to be the first disclosure of the whole
invention if, and only if, DE had been abandoned at the
time Of fil ing of EP-I and had not served as a basis OE
priori ty (Art. 87
If DE had been abandoned before EP—I was filed, EP—2
could validly claim priori ty trom EP-I.
The second further embodiment in EP-2 would not be
entitled to any claim of priority as it was disclosed for
the first time in EP-2.

Amendrnent Of the application may be made after receipt Of the

C)
Amendrnent:s may be made to introduce a reference to prior
art. There is a Board Of Appeal decision which confirms
this. However, this Should relate to background art and
not to an essential element of the invention.
A direct quote should be allOwab1e if it is not used in a
defarnatory
Staternents regarding advantages Of the invention can only
be introduced if the ski11ed man could have derived the
information al ready from the application as filed. These
should not add advantages not al ready embraced by the
application as a whole.
A1 though these may be considered as forming part Of the
discussion Of prior art, and therefore allowable
amendments , it may be that the newly discovered
disadvantages put the invention in a new and advantageous
light, which was not clear at the time Of fil ing the
appl i cation .
Although Such amendments might not be considered added
subject mat ter under Art. 123 (2) , wherein the test for
added subj ect matter may to taken to be whether novelty
is introduced by the addition, it seems likely that Such
amendments might affect the manner in which the
Specification is read. Care should be taken and, on
balance, I would Say that the addition is not al Iowable .
