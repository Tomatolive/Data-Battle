QUESTION 7
(4 marks)
Patent proprietor P has a European patent EP with a claim A for the contracting states DE
and FR and a claim B for the contracting states AT and BE. Claim A comprises all features
of claim B and an additional feature X. Opponent O duly filed an opposition against the
patent in its entirety on the grounds of lack of novelty. The patent was revoked because
the subject matter of claim B was considered to be not novel. During appeal proceedings,
appellant P requests the patent to be maintained with claim A for all the states DE, FR, AT
and BE. Respondent O only notices now that feature X was not originally disclosed and
raises a corresponding objection.
Assuming that feature X was not originally disclosed, can the European patent including
claim A be maintained in proceedings before the EPOQ
QUESTION 8
(7 marks)
Your client filed for his invention INI a French patent application FRI on 01 _032010 and
a European application EPI on 2210.2010. An article published on 12.032010 disclosed
invention INI. Today 01.032011 your client informs you that he received a
communication from the EPO dated 04019011 inviting him to file a missing drawing. This
missing drawing relates to prior art which is not relevant for invention IN 1. He also informs
you that for EPI, instead of claiming priority from FRI, he accidentally claimed priority
from another French patent application FR2 filed on 2210.2009 and disclosing another
invention IN2.
The applicant does not want to file a new EP application and asks you for advice.
