PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2022
If an objection of lack of unity has been raised but it was exceptionally
chosen not to request the applicant to pay additional search fees the ISR is
issued for all inventions, indicating that the application lacks unity and
listing the different groups of inventions. The WO-ISA is completed for all
searched inventions. In Section IV of the WO-ISA the examiner indicates
that the requirement of unity is not fulfilled and that all claims have been
searched and examined and provides full reasons on the separate sheet.
4. Cascading non-unity
If additional search fees are paid in response to an invitation to do so and
the additional search(es) reveal(s) a further lack of unity "a posteriori", no
further invitation to pay further additional search fees is issued.
If the applicant pays (an) additional search fee(s), a search is carried out for
the invention(s) for which the search fee(s) has/have been paid
If the search reveals that one or more of these inventions also lack unity "a
posteriori'l only the first invention of each of the groups of inventions is
searched.
The WO-ISA will be drafted for all the searched inventions. Section Ill must
be modified to cover the inventions actually searched Under Section IV, full
reasons must be given for all the non-unity objections raised Under
Section V an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability
must be given for all searched inventions.
Claims not searched during the intemational phase can be prosecuted
during the regional phase before the EPO in accordance with GUEPO
F-V,_ 7 _ 1, as appropriate.
Example
A lack of unity objection is raised by the EPO acting as ISA, identifying four
different inventions A B, C and D. The first invention A is searched and the
applicant is invited to pay further search fees for inventions B, C and D.
The applicant pays two further search fees for inventions B and C. During
the additional searclm B is found to lack unity "a posteriori" and is divided
into the groups of inventions Bl , 82 and B3.
In this case only Bl and C are searched, so in Section Ill of the WO-ISA
the claims relating to inventions 82, 83 and D are indicated as not
searched In Section IV, full reasons must be given for why the claims of
the application were divided into A, C and D and why B was further
subdivided into 81, 82 and B3_ Under Section V an opinion on patentability
must be given for A Bl and C.
Examination of the application in the European phase will be based on
either A, Bl or C (see QUEPO .E-V„ l.l(.lji))_ For the claims relating to
inventions BZ 83 and D, an invitation under Rule 164(2) EPC will be
issued in accordance with GUEPO F-V, 7. Iliv).
