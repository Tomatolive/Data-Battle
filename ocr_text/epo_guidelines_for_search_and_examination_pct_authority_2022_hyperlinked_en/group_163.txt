2.4 Files arriving late
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
â€” Chapter IV-3
If the demand has been validly received by the EPO very late, the examiner
will telephone the applicant and explain the situation. In such cases
applicants will then be asked whether they prefer to:
discuss the application over the phone and receive a short time limit
to file amendments (e.g. one to two weeks, set by the telephone
minutes); or
receive a WO-IPEA with a short time limit (e.g. one to two weeks); or
receive a negative IPER without further interaction; or
receive a WO-IPEA with a longer time limit, in which case the IPER
will be issued late.
In those very exceptional cases where the file is so late that even with a
time limit of one to two weeks the IPER would be issued after 28 months,
applicants will be asked whether they would like a time limit to file
amendments although the IPER will be late or prefer a timely but negative
IPER without further interaction.
In the above-mentioned exceptional cases where after a telephone
consultation the applicant does not wish to file amendments/observations
but agrees that a negative IPER can be established directly, the examiner
will send a direct negative IPER.
2.5 Request for a further written opinion
Frequently applicants explicitly request a further written opinion (under
Chapter II) if the examiner's opinion is still negative. If the applicant has not
yet had a further opportunity to file amendments in Chapter II, this request
must be granted (see GUPCT-EPO c-IV, 2_2)_
If the applicant has already had a further opportunity to file amendments,
then as a rule the IPER is issued directly (see however also
3. Late-filed reply after a first or further WO-IPEA (408) has been sent
In the PCT procedure, there is no loss of right for applicants if they do not
meet the time limits for replying to a written opinion. The only risk the
applicant takes with a late reply is that it might not be taken into account for
establishing the IPER.
In practice, if the applicant's reply is received after the time limit set in the
WO-IPEA (Form 408) but before an IPER (Form 409) has been started, the
late-filed reply is taken into consideration for drawing up the IPER
If a reply is received after the IPER has actually been started and the
applicant has not met all the objections set out in the last written opinion,
