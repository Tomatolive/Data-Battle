PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part F
â€” Chapter 111-3
For the assessment of the clarity of claims referring to a trademark (Art. 6),
see GUPCT-EPO 48.
8. Reference documents
See ISPE Guidelines 4.26.
Where the reference document relates to the background art, it may be in
the application as originally filed or introduced at a later date
(see GUPCT-EPO F-ll, 43 and GUPCT-EPO H-lk 22.5). Incorporation of
essential matter or essential features at a later date is, however, subject to
the restrictions set out in GLIPQI-E-EQ It may be that the
examiner has requested the applicant to furnish the document referred to,
in order to be able to carry out a meaningful search

9. "Reach-through" claims
Section F-lllz 9 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies
mutatis mutandis
10. Sufficiency of disclosure and or
The application may contain sheets stamped "Not to be considered
(R. 205(e), R 205bis(e) or 20.7)"_ This means that these sheets were not
allowed by the receiving Office (for formal or substantive reasons) or that
the applicant has withdrawn those parts or elements in order to avoid re-
dating of the application. Such sheets thus do not form part of the
application documents and should be ignored for search and examination.
In this case, the examiner must carefully evaluate whether the invention is
still sufficiently disclosed without relying on the technical information
contained in the withdrawn parts or elements. Should the examiner reach
the conclusion that the requirements of Ait 5 are not satisfied, a
corresponding objection is raised. See also GIJPCT-EPO F-lll, 3 to
GUPCT-EPO F-III, 5_
11. Sufficiency of disclosure and clarity
An ambiguity in the claims may lead to an insufficiency objection. However,
ambiguity also relates to the scope of the claims, i_e_ Art 6 (see
GLIPCT-EPO F-IV. 4) Normally, therefore, an ambiguity in a claim will lead
to an objection under Art 5 only if the whole scope of the claim is affected,
in the sense that it is impossible to carry out at all the invention defined
therein. Othervvise an objection under Ait 6 is appropriate
In particular, where a claim contains an ill-defined ("unclear", "ambiguous")
parameter (see also GLIPCT-EPO F-IVZ 4.11) and where as a
consequence, the skilled person would not know whether they were
working within or outside of the scope of the claim, this, by itself, is not a
reason to deny sufficiency of disclosure as required by Alt Nor is such a
lack of clear definition necessarily a matter for objection under Art 6 only.
What is decisive for establishing insufficiency within the meaning of Art. is
whether the parameter in the specific case, is so ill-defined that the skilled
person is not able, on the basis of the disclosure as a whole and using
common general knovvledge, to identify (without undue burden) the
