the late reply is not considered and the 'PER is drawn up on the basis of
the conclusions set out in the last WO-IPEA
If a reply is received after the IPER has actually been started and all the
objections set out in the last WO-IPEA have been met, the late-filed reply is
taken into consideration for drawing up the IPER.
If no reply has been received, the IPER is drawn up on the basis of the
conclusions set out in the last WO-IPEA
4. Consequences of a restriction of the search
4.1 Submissions prompted by a restriction of the search or a
declaration that no search is possible
If the search covered only some claims or part of one or more claims (see
GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII) only the subject-matter which has been searched - as
indicated in the ISR (GL,'PCT-EPO B-X.8) and/or in the WO-ISA
(_GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 6) - can be the object of the international preliminary
examination. It should always be made clear which claims have been
examined.
After a restriction of the search, either because subject-matter is excluded
from the search or because a meaningful search is not possible, or after a
declaration that no search at all is possible, the applicant's reply may, at
subsequent stages of the procedure, challenge the ISA's findings.
However, the IPEA has no responsibility for actions taken by the ISA and
there is no provision in the PCT for an IPEA review of, or for an appeal
against, such an ISA decision.
Any written arguments from the applicant relating to the completeness of
the search are not to be treated as a communication with the IPEA, unless
the applicant's reply contains a complaint against the findings at the search
stage when the EPO acted as ISA (see GUPCT-EPO 4).
If the reply to the WO-ISA contains arguments challenging the findings at
the search stage related to the restriction of the search, the examiner will
mention in the WO-IPEA or 'PER (under Section Ill) that the findings of the
ISA cannot be reviewed by the IPEA.
If the applicant phones the examiner to discuss the issue orally, the
examiner will inform the applicant that this is a matter which is the
responsibility of the ISA under Ch?pter I of the PCT and that the procedure
before the ISA is closed.
If the reply contains amended claims introducing unsearched matter, the
applicant will be informed in the IPER (under Section Ill) that an opinion
cannot be given for unsearched matter.
As explained in GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII, 1, an additional search may be made
after entry into the European phase, in the examination phase, if the
