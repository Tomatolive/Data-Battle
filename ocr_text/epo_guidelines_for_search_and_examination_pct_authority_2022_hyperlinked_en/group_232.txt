For the particular case of claims for a known substance for a number of
distinct medical uses, see GUPCT-EPO G-llz 4.2.
When there is lack of unity, the claimed subject-matter is divided among the
separate inventions. In this context the word "invention" means an invention
having technical character and concemed with a technical problem within
the meaning of Rule 5. which does not necessarily need to meet
other requirements for patentability, such as novelty and inventive step (see
