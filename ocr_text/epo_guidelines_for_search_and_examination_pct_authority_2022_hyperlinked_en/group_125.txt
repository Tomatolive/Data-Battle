PCT-EPO Guidelines
Informal clarification may take the form of a telephone consultation or of a
written request (Form PCT/lSA/207) sent by fax. In both cases the
applicant can be given a short time limit (normally two weeks) to respond.
In view of the short time limits in the PCT, a telephone consultation, for
which minutes must be written, may be more appropriate. If the issues at
stake can be clarified during the telephone consultation, no time limit will be
giverm The examiner will send the minutes of the consultation for
information and will prepare the ISR and WO-ISA taking the result of the
consultation into account.
Alternativelyq a witten request for clarification can be sent by fax. This is in
particular appropriate when dealing with non-European representatives due
to potential time zone differences and linguistic problems, and/or when the
issue to be discussed is not suitable for a telephone consultation.
3.4 Reply to the invitation for informal clarification
3.4.1 Failure to reply in time or no reply
If the applicant does not reply within the set time limit to the invitation for
informal clarification, the examiner will prepare the search report and
WO-ISA to the extent possible without the requested clarification.
If the applicant replies after the time limit has expired, and the search report
has not yet been established, the reply should be taken into account; if the
search report has already been established the reply will not be taken into
accou nt
3.4.2 Reply in time
If the applicant replies to the invitation for informal clarification, the
examiner will prepare the search report and WO-ISA taking the reply into
account _
3.5 The content of the WO-ISA after an invitation for informal
clarification and/or in case of a restriction of the search
Generally, a restriction of the search will not always be indicated in the
international search report. Rather the extent of the search as well as the
reasons for the restriction will in many cases only be indicated in the
WO-ISA as explained below. The opinion given is norrnally restricted to
what has actually been searched
If after clarification a complete search can be made, the ISR will be
designated as complete. Any outstanding clarity problem will be mentioned
in Box VIII of the WO-ISA_
If only some of the claims and/or parts of the claims can be searched and it
is not possible on the basis of the description, to foresee a likely fallback
position for the unsearched subject-matter, even taking any reply from the
applicant into consideratiorm a precise indication of what has been
searched with the corresponding claims, together with full reasoning why
the search was restricted, are entered into both the ISR and the WO-ISA_ In
addition, in the WO-ISA an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and
industrial applicability of the searched subject-matter must be given.
