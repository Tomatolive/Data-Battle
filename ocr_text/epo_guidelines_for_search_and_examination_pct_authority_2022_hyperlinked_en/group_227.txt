Regarding support for dependent

6.2 Extent of generalisation
See ISPE Guidelines 5.52
PCT-EPO Guidelines
claims by the description,
see
Pan F -
Art 5, 6
Chapter IV-9
An invention which opens up a whole new field is entitled to more generality
in the claims than one which is concerned with advances in a known
technology
6.3 Objection of lack of support
See ISPE Guidelines 5.44.
Once the examiner has set out a reasoned case that, for example, a broad
claim is not supported over the whole of its breadth, the onus of
demonstrating that the claim is fully supported lies with the applicant
(see GUPCT-EPO F-lll, 4).
The question of support is illustrated by examples (i) to (iii) in GUEPO
F-IV„ 6.3. See also ISPE Guidelines 5.53.
Where it is found that the claims lack support in the description under
Art O, it may be appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to
provide informal clarification before the search is carried out (see
GUPCT-EPO 3.3-3.6)_
6.4 Lack of support vs. insufficient disclosure
It should be noted that, although an objection of lack of support is an
objection under Ait it can often, as in examples (i) to (iii) of
GLIEPO F-l\vq 6.3, also be considered as an objection of insufficient
disclosure of the invention under Alt 5 (see GL/?CT-EPO F-lll. 1 to
GLIPCT-EPO F-III, 3), the objection being that the disclosure is insufficient
to enable the skilled person to carry out the "invention" over the whole of
the broad field claimed (although sufficient in respect of a narrow
"invention") Both requirements are designed to reflect the principle that the
terms of a claim should be commensurate with, or be justified b•yq the
invention's technical contribution to the an. Therefore the extent to which
an invention is sufficiently disclosed is also highly relevant to the issue of
support The reasons for failure to meet the requirements of An. 5 may in
effect be the same as those that lead to the infringement of Alt 6 as well,
namely that the invention, over the whole range claime4 extends to
technical subject-matter not made available to the person skilled in the art
by the application as filed.
For example, where a technical feature is described and highlighted in the
description as being an essential feature of the invention, to comply with
Art this must also be part of the independent claim(s) defining the
invention (see GL/PCT-EPQ F-IV= 45.1) By the same token, if the
(essential) technical feature in question is absent from the claims and no
information is given on how to perform the claimed invention successfully
without the use of said feature, the description does not disclose the
invention defined in the daim(s) in the manner prescribed by Art. 5.
