(b)
(c)
non-unity cases â€” inventions for which additional search fees were
paid, but not additional examination fees;
subject-matter which, although not excluded from the search, is
excluded from preliminary examination;
In addition to what is mentioned in i..l.tec PCT, the top-up search
may be refused or limited by the EPO as IPEA:
(d)
(f)
where amendments contain added matter;
where there is no letter explaining the basis for amendments and/or
indicating what has been amended in the application;
where the EPO as ISA would not cite any documentary evidence as
to the relevant state of the art (e.g. in case of "notorious knowledge"
in the field of computer-implemented inventions).
In case (d) above the examiner will perform the top-up search based on
either the previous set of application documents or the amended set,
ignoring the added subject-matter. In case (e) above, the same applies to
unsupported amendments (see GUPCT-EPO C-lllz 4)_
Where a top-up search is made for some claims or part of claims, there is
no indication of:
which claims are not covered by the top-up search (this should be
derivable from the indications in Sections I and Ill of the WO/IPER);
why no or only a partial top-up search has been made.
5.3 Documents newly found in the top-up search, when further
objections are present
If the top-up search reveals pertinent prior art, according to present practice
a WO-IPEA or a telephone consultation is the first action in Chapter II
(see GUPCT-EPO c-IVZ 22). If a positive WO-ISA was drafted or the
objections in the negative WO-ISA have been overcome by the applicant's
amendments/arguments, see GUPCT-EPO C-IV, 5.4.
The documents found are indicated as follows:
(b)
If the newly found documents are published after the filing date
(E documents) and are relevant for novelty, they are mentioned in
Section VI of the WO-IPEA and IPER (for the level of detail see
GWPCT-EPO 4_3)_
If the newly found documents are published before the priority date
and are relevant for novelty and/or inventive step, they are
mentioned in Section V of the WO-IPEA and IPER and detailed
reasoning is provided.
