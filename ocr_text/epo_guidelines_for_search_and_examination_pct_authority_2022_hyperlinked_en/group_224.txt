PCT-EPO Guidelines
4.16 use claims
March 2022
The EPO applies the first sentence conceming "use" claims of point
GWISPE A5_21 of the Appendix to Chapter 5 of the ISPE Guidelines.
Thus a claim in the form 'the use of substance X as an insecticide" should
not be interpreted as directed to the substance X recognisable (e.g. by
further additives) as intended for use as an insecticide Similarly, a claim for
"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit" would be equivalent to a
process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the
transistor and should not be interpreted as being directed to "an amplifying
circuit in which the transistor is used", nor to 'the process of using the
transistor in building such a circuit". However, a claim directed to the use of
a process for a particular purpose is equivalent to a claim directed to that
very same process.
Care should be taken when a claim relates to a two-step process which
combines a use step with a product production step This may be the case
e.g when a polypeptide and its use in a screening method have been
defined as the only contribution to the art An example of such a claim
would then be:
"A method comprising:
(a)
(b)
and
contacting polypeptide X with a compound to be screened and
determining whether the compound affects the activity of said
polypeptide;
then forrnulating any active compound into a pharrnaceutical
composition. "
Many variations of such a claim are conceivable, but in essence they
combine (a) a screening step (i.e. using a specified test material to select a
compound having a given property) with (b) further production steps
(i.e further transforming the selected compound for instance into the
desired composition).
Two different types of process claim exist: (i) the use of an entity to achieve
a technical effect and (ii) a process for the production of a product The
above claim and its analogues represent a combination of two different and
irreconcilable types of process claim. Step (a) of the claim relates to a
process of type (i) step (b) to a process of type (ii). Step (b) builds on the
"effect" achieved by step (a), rather than step (a) feeding into step (b) a
specific starting material and resulting in a specific product. This results in
an unclear claim according to Ait 6_
