service may be used for online filing of the demand under PCT Chapter II,
and also for indicating the payment of fees related to the demand.
The EPO will indicate the date of receipt on the demand and promptly notify
the applicant of that date If the demand is filed by fax, no written
confirmation needs to be filed unless the applicant is invited by the EPO as
IPEA to do so.
If the applicant filed the demand incorrectly with the International Bureau
(1B), a receiving Office, an International Searching Authority or a non-
competent Intemational Preliminary Examining Authority, that Office or
Authority or the 1B will mark the date of receipt and will transmit the demand

Swedish or Turkish patent office, the Nordic Patent Institute (NPI) or the
Visegrad Patent Institute (VPI)_
