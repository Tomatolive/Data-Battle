In all examples listed above, the examiner may where appropriate
informally invite the applicant to provide clarification of the claimed sub]ect-
matter (see WPP.T.-E-PO
See ISPE Guidelines 901 and 19-030 for further information.
3.2 Nucleotide and amino acid sequences
If the sequence listing of an international application is not available in
electronic form and/or does not comply with the standard provided in
Annex C to the Administrative Instructions (WIPO Standard ST 25), the
EPO as ISA will invite the applicant to furnish the sequence listing in
electronic text format and pay a late furnishing fee within a non-extendable
time limit of one month from the date of the invitation.
If, within the time limit set, the applicant has not submitted the sequence
listing in the required electronic form and format and paid the late furnishing
fee, the EPO as ISA will carry out the international search without the
sequence listing to the extent that a meaningful search can be carried out
The examiner when performing the search will either:
(i) issue a declaration under Art and that no
meaningful search on any claimed subject-matter is possible due to
the failure of the applicant to comply with 5.2 (no sequence
listing) and/or (no computer-readable sequence
listing);
issue an incomplete search report with a declaration under
Art. and Rule 13ter.1[d) that a meaningful search is not
possible in respect of certain claimed subject-matter due to the
failure to comply with Rule 52 (no sequence listing) and/or
Rule 13ter.1(a) (no computer-readable sequence listing).
This also has consequences for the international preliminary' examination
procedure before the EPO as IPEA (see GUPCT-EPO c-VIII, 21).
3.3 Informal clarification
Where the description, claims or drawings fail to comply with a requirement
such as clarity or support of the claims by the description, to such an extent
that no meaningful search can be made, the examiner may informally
contact the applicant to clarify specific aspects of the application before the
search is carried out Such informal clarification may help the examiner to
focus the search better It is highly recommended to invite the applicant to
provide such informal clarification before issuing an incomplete ISR or a
declaration of no search. However, there is no legal obligation on the
examiner to use it and no legal consequences in the PCT if the applicant
does not respond An incomplete search report or a declaration of no
search may still be issued without prior clarification.
