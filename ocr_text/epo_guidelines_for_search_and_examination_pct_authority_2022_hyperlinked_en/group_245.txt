PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G
Art 33111
— Chapter I-I
Under Art 150(2) EPC, an international application filed under the PCT
may be the subject of proceedings before the EPO_ In such proceedings,
the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations are applie4 supplemented by
the provisions of the EPC In case of conflict, the provisions of the PCT and
its Regulations prevail.
The EPO, acting as ISA or IPEA, has established practice on how the
examiner assesses novelty and inventive step For most subject-matter this
practice is identical to that used in proceedings for European patent
applications. However, for some subject-matter the ISPE Guidelines
deviate from the practice in European proceedings, and for other
subject-matter they recognise that different offces adopt different
approaches. As a result of Art 150(2) EPC, the EPO as ISA/IPEA will, for
the assessment of novelty and inventive step, generally apply the
provisions of the PCT an4 where these are not sufficient, will base its
assessment on its established practice. In the latter case, these Guidelines
then state that 'the principles as laid down in the corresponding section in
the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis."
It should be bome in mind that when an international application validly
enters the regional phase before the EPO, it is considered as a European
patent applicatiorm Consequentlyq the EPO will apply its criteria for
examination as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO for
any sub]ect-matter.
2. General remarks
The aim of the PCT is to allow the applicant to obtain a preliminary' and
non-binding opinion on the patentability of the claimed subject-matter
before entering the regional phase The PCT procedure cannot serve the
purpose of granting a patent as is the case for example under the EPC.
