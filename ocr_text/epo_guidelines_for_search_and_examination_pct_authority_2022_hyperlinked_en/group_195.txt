PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part E
— Chapter Ill-I
Chapter Ill — Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)
1. General
The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) enables an applicant whose claims
have been determined to be patentable/allowable to have a corresponding
application which has been filed with a PPH partner office processed in an
accelerated manner while at the same time allowing the offices involved to
exploit available work results.
Currently, the EPOs PPH partner offices are: JPO (Japan), KIPO (South
Korea), CNIPA (China), USPTO (USA), ILPO (Israel), CIPO (Canada) IMPI
(Mexico), IPOS (Singapore), IPA (Australia) SIC (Colombia), ROSPATENT
(Russian Federation), MylPO (Malaysia), IPOPHL (Philippines), EAPO
(Eurasia), INPI (Brazil) and INDECOPI (Peru).
Under the PPH pilot programme a PPH request can be based on:
(i) the latest PCT work product (WO-ISA or IPRP/IPER) established by
one of the PPH partner offices as ISA or IPEA (PPH based on PCT
work products) (except under the PPH pilot programme with INPI
(Brazil)); or
any national work product (office action
indicating
patentable/allowable claims) established during the processing of a
national application or of a PCT application that has entered the
national phase before one of the PPH partner offices (PPH based on
national work products).
2. PPH based on a WO-ISA established by the EPO as ISA
Where the EPO is the ISA and the International application contains claims
that are determined to be patentable/allowable by the EPO as ISA, the
applicant may under the PPH pilot programme request accelerated
examination at the EPOs PPH partner offices when the application has
entered the national phase before these offices. The procedures and
requirements for filing a request with the EPOs PPH partner offices are
available from their respective websites.
Irrespective of the PPH pilot programme, any applicant may request
accelerated examination under the PACE programme in the procedure
before the EPO as designated Office at any time. See GWEPO a-VIII, 4.2.
3. PPH based on an 'PER established by the EPO as 'PEA
Under the PPH pilot programme, a PPH request can also be based on an
IPER established by the EPO as IPEA. The procedures and requirements
for filing a request with the EPO's PPH partner offices are available from
their respective websites.
Irrespective of the PPH pilot programme, any applicant may request
accelerated examination under the PACE programme in the procedure
before the EPO as elected Office at any time. See GUEPO E-Vlll, 42
