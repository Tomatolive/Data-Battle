5. Limitation of the search for reasons other than non-unity
With respect to limitations of the search for reasons other than non-unity
(including the issuance of a declaration of no search), the same criteria
apply as for any intemational search carried out by the EPO as ISA (see
GUPCT-EPO B-VIIIZ 2, 3 and subsections).
Any such limitation of the search will be indicated in the search report
and/or the annexed explanations (of equal value to the information
contained in a WO-ISA) as set out in and e, with
the exception that in the case of a declaration of no search (Form
PCT/SlSA'502) no explanations from the SISA are provided for. For any
other limitation of the search, the reasoning will be given only in the
explanations annexed to the SISR and an automatic reference thereto will
be inserted in the SISR_
Furthermore, the SISA does not have to search claims which were not
searched by the main ISA. However, the examiner will not limit the SIS
merely on the grounds that the main ISA did so, but will make a case-by-
case assessment based on EPO practice to determine whether the
limitation made by the main ISA was appropriate under EPO practice.
For non-unity: see WPGT.-E-PO 10.
6. Filling out the search report
The SISR is filled out In the same way as for any intemational search, with
the exception that publication details do not have to be provided since the
main ISA has already provided the publication data and IPC classes.
Examiners will not cite in the SISR a document already cited in the ISR
unless they attach a different significance to it, e.g. as a Y document in
combination with a newly cited document or where the main ISR has clearly
failed to recognise the extent of the documents relevance.
Furthermore, it will be indicated in the SISR whether or not the main ISR
was available and taken into account.
7. Explanations under Rule
No separate WO-ISA is established for a SIS_ Instead, only a free-text
sheet is used, and this will contain the same information as the separate
sheet that is part of the WO-ISA in the form of "explanations". Upon entry'
into the European phase, the applicant is obliged to respond to these
explanations, as set out in Rule 161(1) EPC. A positive conclusion must be
reasoned in the same way as in a WO-ISA/IPER.
Formally, the explanations under Rule 45bis7(e) are part of the SISR
(Form PCT/SlSA'501) and are contained in an annex called the 'Scope
Annex".
Although the Scope Annex will concentrate on the documents cited in the
SISR, in some circumstances it might be appropriate to raise objections
based on documents cited in the ISR.
