Rule 205
Rule 20 5b,s
cited against another claim or another altemative in the same claim
because it has an earlier effective date.
If the applicant subsequently furnishes missing parts of the description,
parts of the claims or all or parts of the drawings under Rule 20.5 the
international filing date is the date on which the purported intemational
application is completed by the furnishing of the missing parts, unless the
missing parts are completely contained in the priority document and the
requirements given in Rule 206 are satisfied, in which case the original
filing date is maintained. The date of the application as a whole is thus
either the date on which the missing parts are received or the original filing
date (see GL,'PCT-EPO c-IIIL 2, and GUPCT-EPO H-IL 2.22).
If the applicant subsequently furnishes (a) correct element(s) (an element
being the description or the claims) or correct parts of the description, parts
of the claims or all or parts of the drawings under Rule 20.5bis, the
international filing date is the date on which the purported intemational
application is corrected by the fumishing of the correct elements or parts
unless the correct elements or parts are completely contained in the priority
document and the requirements given in Rule 20.6 are satisfied, in which
case the original filing date is maintained The date of the application as a
whole is thus either the date on which the correct elements or parts are
received or the original filing date (see GLIPCT-EPO C-lll, 2, and
GUPCT-EPO H-ll„ 2.2.2)_
4. Documents in a nonofficial language of the (S)ISA or 'PEA
Where applicants
(i) dispute the relevance of a document in a non-official language cited
in the search report (for procedure at the search stage,
see GUPCT-EPO B-x. 9.1.2 and 9.1_3), and
(ii) give specific reasons,
examiners should consider whether, in the light of these reasons and of the
other prior art available to them, they are justified in pursuing the matter If
so, they should obtain a translation of the document (or merely the relevant
part of it if that can be easily identified). If they remain of the view that the
document is relevant, they should send a copy of the translation to the
applicant with the next communication in the PCT Chapter II phase.
4.1 Machine translations
In order to overcome the language barrier constituted by a document in an
unfamiliar non-official language, it might be appropriate for the examiner to
rely on a machine translation of the document, which should be sent to the
applicant If only part of the translated document is relevant, the particular
passage relied upon should be identified. A translation has to serve the
purpose of rendering the meaning of the text in a familiar language.
Therefore mere grammatical or syntactical errors which have no impact on
the possibility of understanding the content do not hinder its qualification as
a translation.
