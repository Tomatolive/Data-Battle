1. Preliminary remarks
PCT-EPO Guidelines
General Part
The present Guidelines are dedicated to the specific procedures before the
EPO in its capacity as PCT Authoritâ€¢w Their full name is 'Guidelines for
Search and Examination at the European Patent Office as PCT Authority",
or "PCT-EPO Guidelines" for short, and throughout these Guidelines they
are also referred to as "GLIPCT-EPO"
These Guidelines can be used and referred to by examiners and formalities
officers, as well as patent attorneys, in addition to the Euro-PCT Guide
('PCT procedure at the EPQ [International phase and entry into the
European phase], Guide for applicants"), the PCT-RO (Receiving Office)
Guidelines and the PCT ISPE (International Search and Preliminary
Examination) Guidelines. They are complementary to, but not a substitute
for, the ISPE and RO Guidelines, as well as the PCT Applicant's Guide
('WIPO PCT Guide"), all published by WIPO They will exist in parallel with
the Euro-PCT Guide which, as before, has the status of a Notice from the
EPO.
The PCT-EPO Guidelines are published as a standalone document in
electronic format only, and will be revised on a yearly basis at the same
time as the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office ("EP
Guidelines"). The electronic publication includes not only the online version
in HTML format, but also a printable file.
This seventh edition of the PCT-EPO Guidelines is intended to contain a
few further parts of existing internal instructions for examiners and
formalities officers which are considered appropriate for publication. It
should therefore not be expected to be as complete as the EP Guidelines.
The aim is to gradually expand the document with each revision cycle. The
major change with respect to the sixth edition is the further development of
Part A
Any indication from readers drawing attention to errors as well as
suggestions for improvement is highly appreciated and may be sent by

2. Explanatory notes
2.1 Overview
PCT
Affairs,
at
The PCT-EPO Guidelines follow the structure of the EP Guidelines (Parts
A, B, C, E, F, G and H, without D because there is no opposition, limitation
or revocation under the PCT), and as far as possible the organisation within
each part is similar to that of the EP Guidelines, adapted to the
particularities of the PCT system. The sequence of chapters within Part A,
however, differs from that of the EP Guidelines. This is due to the particular
way in which the content is being gradually extended and the structure may
be reconsidered prior to completion of Part A.
