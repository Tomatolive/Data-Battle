PCT-EPO Guidelines
3.4 Record of search strategy
March 2022
Since 1 November 2015, all search reports drawn up by the EPO under
both the PCT and EP procedures, including partial search reports, have
been automatically supplemented with an information sheet entitled
"Information on Search Strategy't If the application lacks unity of invention,
the data contained in this sheet only concerns the invention(s) for which the
search fee(s) has (have) been paid. The information sheet is automatically
generated based on the data entered by the examiner when drawing up the
search report It lists the databases in which the examiner conducted the
prior-art search, the classification symbols defining the extent of the search,
and the keywords selected by the examiner or any other element relating to
the invention to be searched and used to retrieve the relevant prior art
upon publication of a search report drawn up under the PCT procedure, the
information sheet will be made available to the public via file inspection on
WIPO's PATENTSCOPE.
4. Identification of the patent application and type of search report
Section B-Xz 4 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies mutatis
mutandis
5. Classification of the patent application
The EPO as ISA classifies the application according to the IPC and CPC
6. Areas of technology searched
Section B-Xz 6 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies mutatis
mutandis
7. Title, abstract and figure(s) to be published with the abstract (as
indicated on supplemental sheet A)
The international application must contain an abstract and a title (see also
GUPCT-EPO F-ll, 2 and 3). If the search report is published together with
the application (A1 publication), the examiner indicates on supplemental
sheet A:
0)
(ii)
(iii)
the approval or amendment of the text of the abstract, which should
not exceed 150 words;
the approval or amendment of the title of the invention (see also
GUPCT-EPO 7); and
the figure which is to accompany the abstract It is possible to
indicate multiple figures from various sheets but the overall size
should not exceed what could fit on an A4 sheet.
If the application is to be published before the international search report is
prepared (A2 publication, see GLIEPO B-X: 4), the examiner only needs to
prepare the classification data Titles, abstracts and figures are published
as submitted by the applicant.
