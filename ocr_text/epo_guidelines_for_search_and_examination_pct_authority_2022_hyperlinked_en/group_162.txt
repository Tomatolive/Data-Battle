Rule
due time a substantive reply to the WO-ISA in the form of amendments
and/or arguments.
Thus if, after reply to the WO-ISA, there are still objections outstanding,
before issuing a negative IPER the examiner must send:
as a rule, a (further) written opinion (Form 404 WO-IPEA), but:
if a request for a telephone consultation was filed before the (further)
written opinion was issued: telephone minutes,
if a request for either a telephone consultation or a (further) written
opinion (see GUPCT-EPO C-VII: 1) was filed before the (further)
written opinion was issued: a written opinion or telephone minutes,
in either case generally (see GLIPCT-EPO C-VII, 1) with a time limit to
reply which is normally two months, in order to give the applicant a further
opportunity to provide arguments and/or amendments in reply to any
outstanding objections. Documents newly found during the top-up search
(see GUPCT-EPO c-IV, 5) are attached to the WO-IPEA or to the
telephone minutes, as appropriate.
If the applicant has not submitted any response to the negative WO-ISA
with the demand, and the top-up search in does not reveal any
new pertinent prior art, then a negative IPER, repeating the objections
raised in the WO-ISA, will be issued directly.
In the exceptional situation of a non-unitary application, where all inventions
examined were found novel and inventive, but still lacking unity as the only
remaining objection, a negative IPER can be sent directly without a further
WO-IPEA (see GUPCT-EPO c-VIII. 3)_
2.3 Supplementary international search (SIS) by another office
When conducting preliminary examination under Chapter II, the examiner
must also take into account any documents cited in any supplementary'
international search report (SISR) by another office which is available in the
If the SISR has not been received by the EPO 24 months after the priority
date the file will be sent to the examiner anyway. If, after checking, the
examiner concludes that an invitation to pay additional fees in case of lack
of unity (see GUPCT-EPO C-V, 1) or a WO-IPEA (see
GLIPCT-EPO C-IV, 22) has to be sent, this will happen as soon as
possible without awaiting the SISR_
If neither an invitation to pay additional fees in case of lack of unity nor a
WO-IPEA needs to be sent out before the IPER is established, the
examiner waits until 27 months from the priority date to establish the IPER
to allow the SISR to arrive and be taken into account.
If the IPER has not yet been established, the examiner will take the SISR
into account when establishing the IPER
