may, for example, arise if an object is unconditionally sold to a member of
the public, since the buyer thereby acquires unlimited possession of any
knowledge which may be obtained from the object. Even where in such
cases the specific features of the object may not be ascenained from an
extemal examination, but only by further analysis, those features are
nevertheless to be considered as having been made available to the public
This is irrespective of whether or not particular reasons can be identified for
analysing the composition or internal structure of the object. These specific
features only relate to the intrinsic features Extrinsic characteristics which
are only revealed when the product is exposed to interaction with
specifically chosen outside conditions, ege reactants or the like, in order to
provide a particular effect or result or to discover potential results or
capabilities, therefore point beyond the product perse as they are
dependent on deliberate choices being made. Typical examples are the
first or further application as a pharmaceutical product of a known
substance or composition and the use of a known compound for a
particular purpose, based on a new technical effect. Thus, such
characteristics cannot be considered as already having been made
available to the public.
If, on the other hand, an object could be seen in a given place (a factory, for
example) to which members of the public not bound to secrecy, including
persons with sufficient technical knowledge to ascertain the specific
features of the object, had access, all knowledge which an expert was able
to gain from a purely extemal examination is to be regarded as having been
made available to the public In such cases, however all concealed
features which could be ascertained only by dismantling or destroying the
object will not be deemed to have been made available to the public
6.2.2 Agreement on secrecy
The basic principle to be adopted is that subject-matter has not been made
available to the public by use or in any other way if there is an express or
tacit agreement on secrecy which has not been broken, or if the
circumstances of the case are such that such secrecy derives from a
relationship of good faith or trust Good faith and trust are factors which
may occur in contractual or commercial relationships
6.2.3 use on non-public property
As a general rule, use on non-public property, for example in factories and
barracks, is not considered as use made available to the public, because
company employees and soldiers are usually bound to secrecy, save in
cases where the objects or processes used are exhibited, explained or
shown to the public in such places or where specialists not bound to
secrecy are able to recognise their essential features from the outside.
Clearly the above-mentioned "non-public property" does not refer to the
premises of a third party to whom the object in question was unconditionally
sold or the place where the public could see the object in question or
ascertain features of it
6.2.4 Example of the accessibility of objects used
A press for producing light building (hard fibre) boards was installed in a
factory shed. Although the door bore the notice "Unauthorised persons not
