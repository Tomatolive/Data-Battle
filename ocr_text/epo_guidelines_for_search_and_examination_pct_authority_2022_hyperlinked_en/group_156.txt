Int. Phase: Annex E
Rule 66
Rule 58.1 and 583
Sole applicants must have their residence in, or be a national of, a PCT
contracting state bound by PCT Chapter II. If there is more than one
applicant, at least one of the applicants has to fulfil these requirements.
Secondly, the intemational application must have been filed with a
receiving Office of or acting for a PCT contracting state bound by PCT
Chapter II. At present, all PCT contracting states are bound by PCT
Chapter. IL Therefore, these requirements do not stand in the way of any
applicant wishing to file a demand for a pending intemational application.
5. Representation
The demand should indicate the agent or common representative who has
been appointed by the applicant(s) or a sub-agent who has been appointed
by an agent appointed under ("the agent for the international
phase").
Any agent or other person having the right to practice before the EPO
during the European phase is entitled to practice before the EPO as 'PEA
in respect of that application. The same applies to any agent or other
person entitled to practice before the RO with which the international
application was filed (Article 49 PCT).
Where an agent is appointed, any correspondence intended for the
applicant will be sent to the address indicated for the agent.
If there are two or more applicants and no common agent or common
representative is appointed, all correspondence will be sent to the
first-named applicant who has the right to file an international application
with the receiving Office concemed, as this applicant will be considered to
be the common representative ("deemed common representative").
6. Election of states
The filing of the demand constitutes the election of all contracting states
which are designated and are bound by Chapter II of the PCT.
7. Signature
The demand must be signed either by all the applicants or by the (common)
agent or the common representative.
8. Basis for international preliminary examination
The preliminary examination is based on the international application either
as filed or as amended under Article 19 or 34 (see also GLIPCT-EPO C-lll)_
Applicants must indicate on which basis they wish the IPEA to start the
international preliminary' examination â€” the application as originally filed or
with amendments (Article 19 or Article 34); any translations; any comments
about the WO-ISA (indexed ISOREPLY) or about the ISR; a sequence
listing in the language of the IPE where applicable.
Additionally, a fee for preliminary examination and a handling fee are to be
paid (see GUPCT-EPO A-Ill. Tl and 7.2).
