6. The written opinion in cases of a restriction of the search
The extent of the search as well as the reasons for the restriction will in
many cases only be indicated in the WO-ISA_ See GLIPCT-EPO a-VIII, 3.5
for details of whether an indication under Art 17 should be made in the ISR
or only in the WO-ISA_ The opinion given is then normally restricted to what
has actually been searched
Any argumentation and objections presented in the written opinion must be
consistent with the restrictions of the search and the reasons therefor_ See
also
GUPCT-EPO 2,
GUPCT-EPO 3
and
Rule 5 2
Rule 13ter I(a)
OJ EPO 2011, 372

7. Sequence listings
Where the applicant has not filed an electronic sequence listing conforming
to WIPO Standard ST 25 in response to a request from the ISA or has not
paid the late furnishing fee, the WO-ISA will indicate under Section Ill that
the written opinion is limited to the same extent as the search was limited
because the applicant failed to comply with Rule 52 (no sequence listing)
and/or Rule 13ter Ital (no computer-readable sequence listing)
8. Options open to the applicant following receipt of the ISR and
WO-ISA
See ISPE Guidelines 2.15.
If the intemational application subsequently enters the European phase, the
applicant is obliged to reply to any negative WO-ISA or 'PER.
