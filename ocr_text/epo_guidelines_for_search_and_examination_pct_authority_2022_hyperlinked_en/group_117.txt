7.2 The work of the Review Panel
If the applicant pays the additional fees under protest and the protest is
found admissible, the case is referred to the director to appoint a three
member Review Panel, which comprises the examiner in charge, an
examiner as chairperson of the Review Panel and a further examiner This
Review Panel will, in case of entry into the European phase, constitute the
Examining Division. The names of the members of the Review Panel are
made public on Form 212.
The Review Panel is appointed from the moment that the protest is found
admissible. Its purpose is to determine, on the basis of the protest, whether
the request for payment of additional fees by the examiner was justified on
the basis of the reasoning given (see W 11/93). The review does not allow
a re-evaluation to determine possible additional grounds for lack of unity
(see W 9/07, Reasons 2_8)_
The scope of the review is limited to those inventions for which additional
fees have been paid. If the applicant's reasoning is not related to those
inventions, the Review Panel will come to the conclusion that the protest is
not or is only partially justified, depending on the case.
If the Review Panel determines that the protest is wholly justified, it will
inform the applicant with Form 212 (Decision on Protest Ghap.ter.l). This
also applies if the Review Panel's finding results in the application not
lacking unity. It is not necessary' to give any reasons unless the Review
Panel decides that such reasoning would be beneficial. Furthermore, the
Review Panel will order the reimbursement of all the additional fees and the
protest fee. The search will be carried out and the written opinion
established for the inventions for which the fees are paid (see
GUPCT-EPO a-VII, 6.3).
If the Review Panel considers that the protest is not justified at all, it will
communicate this to the applicant using Form 212 Reasoning must be
giverm indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is upheld
and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The search will be
carried out and the written opinion established for the inventions for which
the fees are paid (see GUPCT-EPO a-VIII 6.3).
If the Review Panel considers that the protest is only partially justified, it will
communicate this to the applicant using Form 212 Reasoning must be
giverm indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is partially
upheld and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The search will
be carried out and the written opinion established for the inventions for
which the fees are paid (see GUPCT-EPO B-VII: 6_3)_ The Review Panel
will order the reimbursement of the corresponding additional fees but not
the protest fee.
The formalities officer will send the decision of the Review Panel to the
applicant and the 1B. The decision on protest (Form 212) will be sent out
together with the final ISR and WO-ISA in order to ensure that both are
consistent
