If the applicant wishes to discuss amended claims during a telephone
consultation, a copy of such claims should be sent in advance to the
examiner in order to enable appropriate preparation The time limit for such
submissions will be set by the examiner on the record of the arrangement.
The result of the telephone consultation is recorded by the examiner and
added to the file. The recording will depend upon the nature of the matters
under discussion and will be forwarded to the applicant
If the consultation replaces the second written opinion or takes place after a
reply to a second written opinion but has ended with an agreement on
amendments, Form 428 will include:
a warning that the amendments cannot be made by the IPEA and
an invitation for the applicant to file amended sheets normally within
one month, but at least one month before the deadline for the IPER
(unless as agreed with respect to the late issue of the IPER)_
In those cases where the consultation takes place after a reply to a second
written opinion and no agreement has been reached, applicants are
informed that their arguments will be taken into account when establishing
the PER.
Enquiries as to the processing of files may be filed online using the
dedicated form (EPO Form 1012) (see the Notice from the EPO dated
2 August 2016, OJ EPO 2016. A60)
2. Confidentiality
Without the applicant's authorisation, the 1B and the EPO as IPEA may not
allow access to the file of the international preliminary examination by third
parties, except by the elected Offices once the IPER has been established.
Once the IPER has been established and transmitted to the 1B, the latter
sends a copy of the IPER, together with its translation (as prescribed) and
its annexes (in the original language), to each elected Office. As from that
time, the 1B, on behalf of the EPO as elected Office, also fumishes copies
of the IPER as well as of any document transmitted to it under Rule 71.1 by
the IPEA to anyone who requests them
Once the IPER has been established, at the request of any elected Office,
the EPO as IPEA will provide access to any document contained in its file,
except to any information in respect of which it has been notified by the 1B
that the information has been omitted from publication in accordance with
Rule 482(1) or from public access in accordance with Rule 94.1 (d) or
Provided international publication has taken place once the IPER has been
established, third parties may access the file of the international preliminary
examination via those elected Offices whose national law allows access by
third parties to the file of a national application (see also GL/EPO
E-IX, 2_10)_ Such access may be allowed to the same extent as provided
by the national law for access to the file of a national application.
