Rule 40.2(G] and
40.2(e)
GUISPE 1066-1067
and 10.69
If the applicant has paid additional search fees under protest and the
Review Panel decided that the protest was not justified, the examiner will
follow the decision of the Review Panel and proceed to establish the ISR
and WO-ISA for the inventions for which search fees have been paid In the
ISR and the WO-ISA (Section IV) the examiner will indicate that the
requirement of unity is not complied with. Section Ill will be modified to the
actual payment of fees, and under Section V an opinion as to novelty
inventive step and industrial applicability for all searched inventions will be
given.
The final ISR and WO-ISA will be sent out together with the decision on
protest (Form PCT/lSA/212) in order to ensure that both are consistent
See also below (GUPCT-EPO B-VII, 7), for the protest procedure and the
work of the Review Panel.
7. Protest procedure
The procedure consists of a review within the ISA first by the formalities
officer in charge of the file and then by a Review Panel.
7.1 Admissibility of the protest as checked by the formalities officer
Before Initiating the protest procedure the formal admissibility of the protest
in the sense of Rule 40.2(g) (Chapter l) must be checked.
To be admissible the protest should satisfy the following requirements:
(a)
(b)
The applicant must have paid the prescribed protest fee
and
The payment under protest must be accompanied by a reasoned
statement, i.e the reasoned statement should have been filed with
the payment or at the latest within the time limit set in Form 206.
The reasoned statement must comply with Rule i.e. applicants
should argue why the international application complies With the
requirement of unity of invention or why the amount of the required
additional fee is excessive. In the protest applicants should question the
number of additional fees that they have been invited to pay, and not the
amount of a single additional fee.
The payment of the protest fee and the filing of a purported reasoned
statement are assessed by specially trained formalities officers. If the
formalities officer finds any deficiencies, the applicant is informed of them
by way of Form 212 or Form 224. Any substantive analysis is made by the
Review Panel when assessing the justification of the protest
(see GLIPCT-EPO a-VII, 7.2). If the applicant merely submits a statement
of disagreement without reasoning, the Review Panel will refer to the
reasoning contained in the invitation to pay additional search fees
(Form 206) when taking its decision.
