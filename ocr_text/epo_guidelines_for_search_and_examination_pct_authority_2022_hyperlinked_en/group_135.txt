— Chapter Xl-l
Chapter Xl — The written opinion
1. The written opinion
Under Vhap.te.r l, at the same time as establishing the search report the
search examiner must establish the written opinion of the ISA (WO-ISA) to
be sent to the applicant together with the search report The WO-ISA gives
a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed invention
appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be industrially
applicable When appropriate, an opinion will also be given on added
subject-matteq unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support issues, as
well as formal defects.
The findings of the written opinion must be consistent with the document
categories assigned in the search report and must also be consistent with
any other issues raised in the search report, such as lack of unity of
invention or limitation of the search.
If there are no defects in the application, the WO-ISA will state the reasons
why the application is considered to fulfil the requirements of novelty,
inventive step and industrial applicability
The written opinion (and any informal comments filed by the applicant) will
be made available to the public by the 1B at the same time as the
international publication.
If the application subsequently enters the EP phase, the applicant is
obliged to reply to any negative WO-ISA or IPRP/IPER. The WO-ISA is
thus comparable to the ESOP in the European procedure
2. Basis of the written opinion (WO-ISA)
Applicants cannot amend the application before the search report has been
communicated to them. Consequently, the WO-ISA will always relate to the
application documents as originally filed or a translation thereof, and
subject to the possibility of sequence listings being furnished later for the
purposes of international search (see Rule 13ter.1). Furthermore, any reply
filed by the applicant in response to an invitation for informal clarification
(see E-VIII, 34) will also be taken into consideration when
drawing up the written opinion.
Replacement pages or sheets, filed in response to an invitation by the
receiving Office to correct defects in the international application, are
deemed to be part of the international application "as originally filed". These
sheets are identified with a stamp "SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)" (see
GLIPCT-EPO H-IV, 1). Also, replacement pages or sheets for rectification
of obvious mistakes under Rule 91 (see GUPCT-EPO H-IV: 2) are deemed
to be part of the international application "as originally filed" These sheets
are identified with "RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91 _ 1)"
See GUPCT-EPO H-IV, 2, for the procedure to follow if the rectified sheets
contain added subject matter.
