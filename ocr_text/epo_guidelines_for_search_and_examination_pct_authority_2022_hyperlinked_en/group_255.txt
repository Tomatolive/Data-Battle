PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G
— Chapter IV-3
A general statement that machine translations as such cannot be trusted is
not sufficient to contest the value of the translatiorm If the applicant objects
to the use of a specific machine translation, the applicant bears the burden
of adducing evidence (in the form of, for instance, an improved translation
of the whole or salient parts of the document) showing the extent to which
the quality of the machine translation is defective and should therefore not
be relied upon.
When the applicant provides substantiated reasoning for questioning the
objections raised based on the translated text the examiner will have to
take these reasons into account, similarly to when the publication date is
questioned.
5. Conflict with other applications
5.1 Prior art pursuant to Rules 33.11c) and 64.3
Under the PCT, the prior art does not comprise the content of other
applications filed or validly claiming a priority date earlier than — but
published on or after— the date of filing or valid date of priority of the
application being examined. However, attention must be drawn to such
applications in the international search report and, where applicable, the
preliminary examination report, as they may become relevant under
Article 5413) (see also GUPCT-EPO 43). By the "content" of an
application is meant the whole disclosure, i.e. the description, drawings and
claims, including:
(iii)
any matter explicitly disclaimed (with the exception of disclaimers for
unworkable embodiments);
any matter for which an allowable reference (see GUEPO F-lll. 8,
penultimate paragraph) to other documents is made; and
prior art insofar as explicitly described
However, the "content' does not include any priority document (the purpose
of such document being merely to determine to what extent the priority date
is valid for the disclosure of the international application).
5.2 Co-pending applications
The PCT does not deal explicitly with the case of co-pending international
applications of the same applicant of the same effective date, see
ISPE Guidelines 11 _ 10.
6. Prior art made available to the public anywhere in the world by
non-written disclosure
A non-wntten disclosure is not considered part of the prior art for the
purposes of Ait. 33(2) and (3) if the date of that non-written disclosure is
indicated in a written disclosure which has been made available to the
public on or after the relevant date of the application (i.e. on or after the
intemational filing date or, if a priority has been validly claimed, the earliest
priority date).
