admitted', customers (in particular dealers in building materials and clients
who were interested in purchasing light building boards) were given the
opportunity of seeing the press although no form of demonstration or
explanation was given. An obligation to secrecy was not imposed as,
according to witnesses, the company did not consider such visitors as a
possible source of competition. These visitors were not genuine specialists,
i.e. they did not manufacture such boards or presses, but were not entirely
laymen either In view of the simple construction of the press, the essential
features of the invention concemed were bound to be evident to anyone
observing it There was therefore a possibility that these customers, and in
particular the dealers in building materials, would recognise these essential
features of the press and, as they were not bound to secrecy, they would
be free to communicate this information to others.
6.2.5 Example of the inaccessibility of a process
The subject of the patent concems a process for the manufacture of a
product As proof that this process had been made available to the public
by use, a similar already known product was asserted to have been
produced by the process claimed. However, it could not be clearly
ascertained, even after an exhaustive examination, by which process it had
been produced
6.3 Prior art made available by means of oral description
If the prior art was made available to the public by an oral description
before the relevant date (i.e. the date of filing of the application or, if
applicable, the date of the earliest validly claimed priority) but a document
which reproduces the oral description was only published on or after that
relevant date, the ISR and the IPER draw attention to this non-written
disclosure in the manner provided for in Rule 70.9 (Rules 331(b) and 64.2).
6.4 Intemet disclosures
As a matter of principle, disclosures on the internet form part of the prior
art Information disclosed on the internet or in online databases is
considered to be publicly available as of the date the information was
publicly posted. Internet websites often contain highly relevant technical
information. Certain information may even be available only on the intemet
from such websites. This includes, for example, online manuals and
tutorials for software products (such as video games) or other products with
a short life cycle.
As regards establishing the publication date and the standard and burden
of proof, in particular with technical journals or "print equivalent'
publications, the principles as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination
in the EPO (GUEPO G-M 7.5_1-7.5.6) apply mutatis mutandis
6.5 Standards and standard preparatory documents
The principles as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO
(GLIEPO G-IV. 7.6) apply mutatis mutandis
