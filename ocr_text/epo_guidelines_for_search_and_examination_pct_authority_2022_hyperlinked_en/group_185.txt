PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
— Chapter IX-I
Chapter IX — Special requests
1. Withdrawal of demand under Chapter II
Applicants are entitled to a refund of the whole amount of the intemational
preliminary examination fee if the demand is withdrawn before 30 months
from the priority date and on condition that intemational preliminary
examination has not started. If the examiner has actually started to
examine the file, no refund will be made. The starting date of intemational
preliminary examination can in most cases be derived from Form
PCT/lPEA/40g, which in Box I, point 6, indicates the date of the top-up
search (Rule 70.2(f)) GUPCT-EPO c-IV, 5.1, explains that the top-up
search is conducted at the start of intemational preliminary examination
and is usually not repeated before the IPER is issued
The withdrawal of the demand will be effective upon receipt of a notice from
the applicant to the 1B. However, the applicant may also submit the notice
of withdrawal to the EPO as In this case, the EPO as IPEA marks the
date of receipt on the notice and transmits it promptly to the 13 The notice
is considered to have been submitted to the 1B on its date of receipt at the
EPO as IPEA.
The signature of each applicant is required if the demand under Chapter II
is withdrawn.
2. Request for examination of a different set of claims
The filing of different sets of claims for different elected States or of
different (main and auxiliary) requests based on different sets of claims is
not accepted since examining such claims is both time-consuming and
against the intention of the PCT. Auxilian/ requests are not provided for
under the PCT because Rule 66.1(c) provides thav where Art. 19
amendments are made, the international preliminary examination is based
on these amendments unless they are superseded or reversed by a later
amendment under Ait. 34, and furthermore because Rule 70.16(a) provides
for the annexing of the latest set of application documents to the 'PER. The
simultaneous examination of several co-pending requests is not compatible
with the sequential consideration of single requests provided for in the
above-mentioned Rules.
If it is clear which request is the preferred (e_g_ the main request), the
WO-IPEA/IPER is established on that request; a remark is added in the
WO-IPEA/IPER that the treatment of different requests (or main and
auxiliary requests) is not provided for under the PCT.
If it is not clear which request is preferred (different requests with no
preferred order), the applicant is asked, preferably by telephone, to furnish
one set only or to state which set/request should be used for the
examination
If the applicant does not reply and/or insists on a plurality of sets, the
WO-IPEAIIPER is drawn up on the first set, with a remark on the separate
sheet under Section l.
