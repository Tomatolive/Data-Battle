6.1 Types of non-written disclosure, in particular use, and instances
of prior art made available in any other way
Making available to the public may occur by means of an oral disclosure,
use, exhibition or other non-written means Use may be constituted by
producing, offering, marketing or otherwise exploiting a product, or by
offering or marketing a process or its application or by applying the
process. Marketing may be effected, for example, by sale or exchange
Prior art may also be made available to the public in other ways, as for
example by demonstrating an object or process in specialist training
courses or on television.
Availability to the public in any other way also includes all possibilities
which technological progress may subsequently offer of making available
the aspect of the prior art concerned
It should be bome in mind that for the purposes of the intemational search
and the intemational preliminary examination a non-written disclosure is to
be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of Art. 33(2) and (3) only
if its content is confirmed by a written disclosure that was made available to
the public earlier than the relevant date as defined by Rule 641 (b).
6.2 Matters to be determined as regards use
When the ISA or the IPEA has gained knowledge of an object or process
that has been used in such a way that it is comprised in the prior art
(e.g. by a third party, see GUPCT-EPO E-li, Guidelines 16.57 and
PCT/AI section 801), the following details have to be determined:
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
whether there is a written disclosure that was made available to the
public earlier than the relevant date as defined by Rule 64.1 (b) which
confirms the use of the object or the process;
the date on which an alleged use occurred, i.e. whether there was
any instance of use before the relevant date (prior use);
what has been used, in order to determine the degree of similarity
between the object used and the subject-matter of the application;
and
all the circumstances relating to the use, in order to determine
whether and to what extent it was made available to the public, as for
example the place of use and the form of use. These factors are
important in thav for example, the details of a demonstration of a
manufacturing process in a factory' or of the delivery and sale of a
product may well provide information as regards the possibility of the
subject-matter having become available to the public
6.2.1 General principles
Subject-matter should be regarded as made available to the public by use
or in any other way if, at the relevant date, it was possible for members of
the public to gain knowledge of the subject-matter and there was no bar of
confidentiality restricting the use or dissemination of such knowledge. This
