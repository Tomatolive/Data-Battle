PCT-EPO Guidelines
Pat c
— Chapter V-1
Chapter V — Unity of invention
1. unity of invention under
If an invitation to pay additional fees was issued during Ch?pter I and the
applicant paid some or all of the required additional fees, and if, where
applicable, the objection as to lack of unity was at least partly upheld during
a protest procedure, then under Chapter II the applicant will normally be
invited (using Form 405) to pay additional examination fees if all the
searched inventions are also to be examined under Chapter IL Inventions
for which no search fees were paid cannot be pursued and will thus also
not be objected to or commented om A review of the decision taken under
Chapter I is not provided for in the PCT.
A single WO-IPEA/IPER is then drafted by the examiner, dealing with all
the inventions for which examination fees have been paid.
In reply to the WO-ISA the applicant may have filed redrafted claims which
differ substantially from those for which lack of unity was raised. In such a
case it should be carefully considered whether.
the lack of unity objection still applies to the new set of claims
the amended claims relate to searched subject-matter
the reasoning as to lack of unity has to be amended because of the
new claims and/or the arguments presented.
Normally, the examiner under Chapter II agrees with the objection made at
the search stage. Exceptionally, if this is not the case (ege if the search and
WO-ISA were made by another office), it is possible to send out an
invitation to pay further examination fees (Form 405) even if this was not
done at the search stage. However if a lack of unity objection was raised at
the search stage resulting in a partial search and a different conclusion is
reached under Chapter there is no possibility to ask for an additional
search for unsearched subject-matter. In this case, examination in
Chapter II is restricted to what has been searched
Furthermore, it is possible that the original claims did not lack unity but the
amended claims do. In such a case, if the amended claims lacking unity
relate to unsearched subject-matter, they are not examined, and a
WO-IPEA/IPER is established on searched subject-matter only (no
Form 405 is to be sent out). On the other hand, if e.g. the applicant has
generalised the original independent claim so that it is no longer novel and
lack of unity a posteriori occurs, then an invitation to pay additional fees is
sent before the WO-IPEA/IPER
For information on the exceptional situation of a non-unitary application,
where all inventions examined were found novel and inventive, but still
lacking unity as the only remaining objection, see GUPCT-EPO C-VIII, 3
