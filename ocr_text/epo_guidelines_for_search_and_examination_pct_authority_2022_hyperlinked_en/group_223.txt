Chapter IV-5
Claims for products defined in terms of a process of manufacture are
allowable only if the products as such fulfil the requirements for
patentability, i.e. inter alia that they are new and inventive. A product is not
rendered novel merely by the fact that it is produced by means of a new
process. A claim defining a product in terms of a process is to be construed
as a claim to the product as such. The claim may for instance take the form
'ProductX obtainable by process Y". Irrespective of whether the term
"obtainable", "obtained", "directly obtained" or an equivalent wording is
used in the product-by-process claim, it is still directed to the product per se
and confers absolute protection upon the product
As regards novelty, when a product is defined by its method of
manufacture, the question to be answered is whether the product under
consideration is identical to known products. The burden of proof for an
allegedly distinguishing "product-by-process" feature lies with the applicant,
who has to provide evidence that the modification of the process
parameters results in another product, for example by showing that distinct
differences exist in the properties of the products. Nevertheless, the
examiner needs to fumish reasoned argumentation to support the alleged
lack of novelty of a product-by-process claim, especially if this objection is
contested by the applicant.
