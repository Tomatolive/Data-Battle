PCT-EPO Guidelines

observations or amendments the applicant wishes to make should
therefore be addressed to the elected Offices and not to the IPEA.
Only when there is an error in the IPER or the 'PER has been issued when
in fact a second written opinion should have been issued (see
GLIPCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2) will the file be transmitted to the examiner to
decide whether or not to issue a corrected IPER_
In rare cases, the report may be incorrect, for example because it was
based on wrong application documents or citations which are wrongly cited
or are not comprised in the state of the art or on new documents cited for
the first time in the IPER, or because amendments to the claims were
overlooked
In such cases, if there is at least one week before the actual deadline
(normally 28 months from the priority date), a new Form 409 is completed
with the correct information, and the corrected IPER is sent to the applicant
and to WIPO
In cases where there is less than one week before that deadline, or where
the deadline has expired, applicants are called to ask whether they still
wish to receive a corrected IPER. If this is the case, a corrected 'PER is
issued. If the applicant declines to wait for a corrected IPER because of the
deadline, Form 428 (minutes of telephone consultation) is completed
indicating the error in the IPER such that, in the regional phase, the
applicant may cite the content of this form as evidence, and Form 428 is
transmitted for information.
If, despite the applicant's request for rectification, the 'PER does not
contain any of the defects mentioned above, the formalities officer informs
the applicant with a standard letter that the intemational preliminary
examination phase has come to an end. Any further comments may only be
addressed to the elected Offices on entry into the national phase.
