Stopper (10, 20, 30) for inserting into the neck of a bottle to close the bottle,
whereby:
- the stopper (10, 20, 30) comprises a body (2) made of liquid-impermeable and
air-impermeable material,
the body (2) has a first planar surface and a second planar surface,
the body (2) has an air channel (3) opening at least on the first planar surface,
a filtering unit (4) is attached on the first planar surface,
- the stopper (10, 20, 30) is arranged so that air can pass through the
stopper (10, 20, 30) via the filtering unit (4) and the air channel (3),
the first planar surface is inside the bottle and the second planar surface is
outside the bottle when the stopper (10, 20, 30) closes the bottle.

channel extending from the first planar sulface to the second planar surface.
Stopper (20) according to claim VI whereby the air channel (3) is a through-hole
extending from the first planar surface to the second planar surface and the
filtering unit (4) is attached to cover an end of the through-hole.
