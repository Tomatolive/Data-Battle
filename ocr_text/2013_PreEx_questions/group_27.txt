Claim analysis
QUESTION 16
For this question consider only claim V_2 of claim set V and assume that:
a) the EPO examiner considers D4 to be the closest prior art;
b) the EPO examiner identifies the straight air channel extending from the first planar
surface to the second planar surface as the distinguishing feature with respect to [)4.
For each of the statements 16.1 â€” 164, indicate on the answer sheet whether the
statement is true or false.
Given a) and b), a valid identification of a technical effect for claim using the
problem-solution approach is that
16.1
16.2
_ a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to the second
planar surface is quicker to manufacture than foam.
with a straight air channel extending from the first planar sulface to the second
planar surface it is easier to determine by its diameter the rate of exchange of
gasses _
16.3 with a straight air channel extending from the first planar sulface to the second
planar surface the rate of exchange of gasses is determined only by the gas
permeability of the filter plate.
16.4 the provision of a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to
the second planar sulface saves material of the stopper.
