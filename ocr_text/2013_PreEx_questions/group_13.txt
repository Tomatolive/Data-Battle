Description of Client's Patent Application (Filed on 01.03.2010)
[001] The present invention relates to stoppers for wine bottles.
[002] Bottle stoppers for wine bottles comprising a body made of cork are known (see for
example document Dl). Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork is a
material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels
running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and to gasses
such as air. However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air channels. Thus,
cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to gasses such as air. When a bottle
stopper made of cork closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the
interconnected air channels of the cork between the interior and the exterior of the
bottle. An exchange of gasses benveen the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the
bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses
through the stopper differs from wine to wine.
[003] A drawback with these known stoppers is that the gas permeability of the cork
varies greatly depending on the tree from which it was sourced. It is therefore difficult to
predict how quickly wine will mature in bottles closed with these stoppers.
[004] It is an object of the present invention to provide bottle stoppers which overcome
this drawback. This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the attached claims.
