[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a bottle with an improved seal
between the stopper and the neck of a bottle compared to stoppers made only from
cork.
[002] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 200, with one half cut away. The stopper 200 comprises a
cylindrical core 202a made of cork and a cylindrical tube 202b made of synthetic rubber.
The synthetic rubber is impermeable to liquids and gasses.
[003] When the stopper 200 closes a bottle, the core 202a enables air to be exchanged
between the interior and exterior of the bottle via a randomly distributed, continuous
network of interconnected air channels running through the cork. The tube 202b ensures
that the cork core 202a does not disintegrate when the stopper 200 is in contact with
wine for a long time.
[004] The stopper 200 is made by gluing a cylindrical core 202a made of cork into a
cylindrical tube 202b made of synthetic rubber. A strong glue is used so that the
core 202a does not detach from the tube 202b, even when the bottle is opened using a
corkscrew.
