[001] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 100 for closing a bottle, with one half cut away. The
stopper 100 is made of cork. Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork
is a material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air
channels running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and
to gasses such as air However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air
channels. Thus, a stopper made of cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to
gasses such as air.
[002] An exchange of gasses benveen the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the
bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. When the bottle stopper 100 closes the neck
of a bottle, gasses can flow between the interior and the exterior of the bottle via the
air channels 103. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses through the cork differs from
wine to wine.
