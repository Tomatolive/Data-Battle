Document D3 (Published April 2002)
[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a bottle, which can be easily
compressed when it is inserted into the neck of the bottle. This makes it easy to insert
the stopper into the neck of the bottle
[002] FIG. 1 shows the stopper 300, with one half cut away. The stopper 300 comprises
a cylindrical body 302 and a through-hole 303. The body 302 is made of natural or
synthetic rubber. Rubber is a resilient material which is impermeable to liquids and
gasses. Synthetic rubber is preferred, since it is less prone to deteriorate over time than
natural rubber. Due to the through-hole the stopper can be easily compressed.
[003] FIG. 2 shows, in cross section, the stopper 300 after it has been insened into the
neck of a bottle 305. The body 302 is compressed and the lower pan of the through-hole
is completely closed. The stopper is completely impermeable to liquids and gasses and
tightly closes the bottle.
