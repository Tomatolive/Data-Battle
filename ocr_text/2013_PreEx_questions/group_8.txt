QUESTION 6
In Janua1Y 2009, the international application PCT-I was filed in Japanese at the
Japanese Patent Office. A translation of PCT-I into English was provided upon entry
into the European phase. In the examination phase before the EPO, the applicant notes
that a term of the description was incorrectly translated into English. The applicant now
requests the correction of this translation error
For each of the statements 6.1 â€” 64, indicate on the answer sheet whether the
statement is true or false.
6.1
62
6.3
The correction can only be made if it is immediately evident from the English
translation as filed upon entry into the European phase.
The correction can be made if it has a basis in the Japanese text as originally
filed at the Japanese Patent Office.
A wrongly translated term in a European patent application can always be
replaced by the correct term given in the priority document
The correction cannot be made because PCT-I was not filed in an official
language of a Contracting State of the European Patent Organisation.
