Claim analysis
For this question also assume that.
a) the closest prior art is D4;
b) the objective technical problem is "to provide a stopper having a filter plate
whereby the filter plate is securely held"
For each of the statements 19.1 â€” 19.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the
statement is true or false.
Given a) and b), a valid argument as to why it is not obvious to solve the objective
technical problem by the features of claim VI is that
19.1
starting from D4, the person skilled in the art would not consider to combine it
with the teaching of Dl , since the stopper of Dl is made of cork instead of
synthetic rubber as is the stopper of D4.
19.2
_ starting from D4, and considering D2, which teaches to use a strong glue, the
skilled person would glue the filter plate of D4 to the body of D4 using a strong
glue but would not consider integrating the filter plate of D4 within the body of D4_
19.3
starting from D4, the person skilled in the art would not consider to combine it
with the teaching of D3, since D3 does not provide a filter plate.
194
starting from D4 alone, the person skilled in the art would not consider to
provide two air channels.
