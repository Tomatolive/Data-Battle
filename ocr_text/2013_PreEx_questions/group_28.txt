Claim analysis
QUESTION 17
For this question consider only claim V_3 of claim set V and assume that:
a) the EPO examiner considers D4 to be the closest prior art;
b) the EPO examiner identifies as a distinguishing feature with respect to D4 the fact
that the air channel is a through-hole extending from the first planar surface to the
second planar surface and that the filter unit is attached to cover an end of the
through-hole.
For each of the statements ITI â€” 174, indicate on the answer sheet whether the
statement is true or false.
Given a) and b), a valid formulation of the objective technical problem for analysing
claim V.3 using the problem-solution approach is
