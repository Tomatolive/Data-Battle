Claim analysis
[006] The bottle stopper 10 of FIG. 1 comprises a body 2 The body 2 is made of
synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to liquid and gas. The bottle
stopper 10 further comprises a narrow air channel 3, which extends through the body 2.
When the stopper closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the air channel
between the interior and the exterior of the bottle. Because the air channel 3 is very
narrow, liquid cannot flow through it. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses for
maturing a specific wine can be achieved by selecting a stopper 10 having an air
channel 3 of an appropriate diameter.
[007] The second embodiment of our invention enables the rate of exchange of gasses
through a stopper to be more precisely determined. The bottle stopper 20 of FIG. 2
comprises all the components of the bottle stopper 10 shown in FIG. 1. The bottle
stopper 20 additionally comprises a filter plate 4. The filter plate 4 is attached to the
body 2 with glue.
[008] The filter plate 4 can for example be made of an aluminium foil with perforations
forming micro air channels. The filter plate 4 has a predetermined permeability to gasses
such as air but is impermeable to liquids. The filter plate 4 therefore prevents liquids
from coming into contact with the air channel 3 The diameter of the air channel 3 and
the gas permeability of the filter plate 4 determine the gas permeability of the stopper 20.
[009] The filter plate may fall into the wine if it is pushed away from the body of the
stopper by a corkscrew when opening the wine bottle. For this reason bottle stoppers of
the second embodiment should be made longer than conventional bottle stoppers.
