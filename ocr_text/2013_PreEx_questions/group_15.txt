Claim analysis
[010] The bottle stopper 30 of FIG. 3 comprises a body 2 The body 2 is made of
synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to all fluids, whereby the term
fluids includes both liquids and gasses. The bottle stopper 30 further comprises a first air
channel 34 a second air channel 3b and a filter plate 34. The first air channel 3a
extends from a first planar surface of the stopper 30 through the body 2 The second air
channel 3b continues from the first air channel 3a and extends through the body 2 up to
a second planar surface opposite to the first planar surface. The filter plate 34 is fixed
within the body 2 so that gasses can flow between the first air channel 3a and the
second air channel 3b through a part of the filter plate 34. Fixing the filter plate 34 within
the body prevents the filter plate 34 from falling into the wine by the action of a
corkscrew.
[011] The filter plate 34 can be made of any metal foil with pefforations forming micro air
channels, thereby providing a predictable permeability to gasses such as air but being
impermeable to liquids. Hence, the gas permeability of the stopper 30 is determined by
selecting the diameter of the air channels 3a and 3b and by selecting a filter plate 34
with a predetermined gas permeability
