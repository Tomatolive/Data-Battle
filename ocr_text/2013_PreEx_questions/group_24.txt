[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a wine bottle. Exchange of gasses
between the interior and exterior of a wine bottle is necessary for wine to mature. Red
wine requires more gas to be exchanged than white wine.
[002] The stopper comprises a body made of synthetic rubber. Synthetic rubber is a
material which is impermeable to liquids and to gasses such as air. However, when
synthetic rubber is produced as a foam, the synthetic rubber foam becomes gas
permeable via a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels
running through the synthetic rubber foam. The rate at which gasses can flow through
the synthetic rubber foam cannot be predicted due to the random distribution of the air
channels.
[003] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 400 with part cut away. It comprises a body 402 made of
synthetic rubber foam and a filter plate 404. The filter plate 404 is glued onto a first
planar surface of the body 402 The filter plate 404 is made of an aluminium foil with
perforations forming micro air channels. The filter plate 404 prevents wine from coming
into contact with the synthetic rubber foam.
[004] When the stopper closes the neck of a bottle, the filter plate 404 is located inside
the bottle. Gasses can flow between the inside and the outside of the bottle via the micro
air channels in the filter plate 404 and the air channels in the body 402
[005] The stopper 400 comprises a blind hole 405 formed when producing the synthetic
rubber foam. The blind hole 405 has an opening on a second planar sulface of the
stopper. The second planar surface is on the outside of the bottle when the stopper is
inserted in a bottle. The hole 405 acts as a guide for inserting a corkscrew 406 into the
stopper 400.
