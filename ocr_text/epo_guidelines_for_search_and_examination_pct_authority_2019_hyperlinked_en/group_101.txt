PCT-EPO Guidelines
Pan B
Chapter VII-3
5. Documents relevant only to other inventions
The provisions of section B-VII,_ 1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the
EPO apply mutatis mutandis.
6. Reply from the applicant to the invitation to pay additional search
6.1 No payment of additional search fees
If, after an Invitation to pay additional search fees, the applicant does not do
so, the file will not be returned to the examiner, but the final search report
and the WO-ISA which were already prepared by the examiner at the initial
search stage, will be sent out by the formalities officer.
6.2 Payment of additional search fees without protest
If, after an invitation to pay additional search fees, the applicant has paid
additional search fees without protest, a complete search will be carried out
for the inventions for which search fees have been paid and the ISR will be
issued for these inventions. The WO-ISA will be drafted for the claims for
which search fees have been paid. Section IV is to be filled out, and
Section Ill must be modified to the actual payment of fees.
6.3 Payment of additional search fees under protest
In reply to Form 206, the applicant may pay some or all of the additional
fees under protest. If he does, then this triggers the protest procedure for
determining whether the request for payment of the additional fees was
justified (see also GLIPCT-EPO 7).
If the applicant has paid additional search fees under protest and the
Review Panel decided that the protest was fully or partly justified, the
examiner will follow the decision of the Review Panel and will proceed to
establish the ISR and WO-ISA for the inventions for which search fees
have been paid. In the ISR the examiner will adapt the number of
inventions and their definitions as well as the non-unity reasoning to be
consistent with the decision of the review panel. In the WO-ISA Section IV
and the reasoning will be adapted to the decision of the Review Panel and
Section Ill will be modified to the actual payment of fees Under Section V
an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability for all
searched inventions will be given.
In the special situation where the protest was fully justified and where, as a
consequence, the application is considered unitary', the examiner will follow
the decision of the Review Panel and send a final ISR with no indication of
non-unity_ In Section IV of the WO-ISA the examiner will indicate that the
requirement of unity of invention is complied with and that the search report
has been established in respect of all parts of the application; no reasons
need to be given on the separate sheet Under Section V, an opinion as to
novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability for all claims will be given.
If the applicant has paid additional search fees under protest and the
Review Panel decided that the protest was not justified, the examiner will
follow the decision of the Review Panel and proceed to establish the ISR
and WO-ISA for the inventions for which search fees have been paid. In the
