ISR and the WO-ISA (Section IV) he will indicate that the requirement of
unity is not complied with. Section Ill will be modified to the actual payment
of fees, and under Section V an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and
industrial applicability for all searched inventions will be given.
The final ISR and WO-ISA will be sent out together with the decision on
protest (Form PCT/ISA212) in order to ensure that both are consistent.
See also below (GLIPCT-EPO B-VIIZ 7), for the protest procedure and the
work of the Review Panel.
7. Protest procedure
The procedure consists of a review within the ISA first by the formalities
officer in charge of the file and then by a Review Panel.
7.1 Admissibility of the protest as checked by the formalities officer
Before initiating the protest procedure the formal admissibility of the protest
in the sense of Rule (Chapter l) must be checked.
To be admissible the protest should satisfy the following requirements.
Rule 40.210) and
GUISPE 10 66-1067
and 10.69

(a)
(b)
The applicant must have paid the prescribed protest fee
(Rule 40.2(e)), and
The payment under protest must be accompanied by a reasoned
statement, i.e. the reasoned statement should have been filed with
the payment or at the latest within the time limit set in Form 206_
The reasoned statement must comply with Rule 40.2(c); i.e. the applicant
should argue why the intematlonal application complies with the
requirement of unity of invention or why the amount of the required
additional fee is excessive In the protest the applicant should question the
number of additional fees that he has been invited to pay, and not the
amount of a single additional fee.
The payment of the protest fee and the filing of a purported reasoned
statement are assessed by specially trained formalities officers If the
formalities officer finds any deficiencies, the applicant is informed of them
by way of Form 212 or Form 224_ Any substantive analysis is made by the
Review Panel when assessing the justification of the protest
(see GLIPCT-EPO a-VII, 7.2). If the applicant merely submits a statement
of disagreement without reasoning the Review Panel will refer to the
reasoning contained in the invitation to pay additional search fees
(Form 206) when taking its decision.
7.2 The work of the Review Panel
If the applicant pays the additional fees under protest and the protest is
found admissible the case is referred to the director to appoint a three-
member Review Panel, which comprises the examiner in charge, an
examiner as chairperson of the Review Panel and a further examiner. This
Review Panel will, in case of entry into the European phase, constitute the
