PCT-EPO Guidelines

Where the subject-matter of all claims constitutes a subject excluded from
the search, a declaration of non-establishment of the international search
report is issued pursuant to Article on Form PCT/lSAt203,
indicating the reasons A written opinion is established, even though, in the
absence of a search, it cannot address the questions of novelty and
inventive step and may not be able to address other questions such as that
of industrial applicability. The written opinion should contain full reasoning
as to why the search is not possible
2.1 Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery
