If only some of the claims and/or parts of the claims can be searched and it
is not possible, on the basis of the descriptiorm to foresee a likely fallback
position for the unsearched subject-matter, even taking any reply from the
applicant into consideration, a precise indication of what has been
searched with the corresponding claims, together with full reasoning why
the search was restricted, are entered into both the ISR and the WO-ISA. In
addition, in the WO-ISA an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and
industrial applicability of the searched subject-matter must be given.
If some claims or parts of claims cannot be searched but it is possible, on
the basis of the description, to foresee a searchable fallback position,
taking any possible reply from the applicant into consideration, the ISR will
be filled out as for a complete search in respect of those claims An
indication which claims have been searched (in part), together with full
reasoning why the search was restricted, and a precise indication of what
has been searched are entered into the WO-ISA. In the ISR the cited
documents will relate to the searched (or partially searched) claims only. In
addition, in the WO-ISA an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and
industrial applicability of the searched subject-matter must be given.
If, even taking any reply from the applicant into consideration, it is not
possible to perform a search at all, a declaration of no searclm together with
full reasoning why, is issued instead of the ISR. The WO-ISA must contain
full reasoning why the search is not possible.
A restriction of the search due to exceptions mentioned in Rule 39
(e.g. medical treatment claims) must always be indicated in the search
report
3.6 Combination of an incomplete search and lack of unity
The requirements of unity of invention and the requirements of
Ait are separate requirements. However, it is possible that an
application both violates the requirements of clarity, disclosure, support or
conciseness to such an extent that a meaningful search cannot be carried
out, and lacks unity. In that case, the examiner can combine an incomplete
search and a finding of non-unity_ Howeveq the applicant should not be
invited to pay additional fees for subject-matter which will later not be
searched under Art. Typically, a non-unity objection could be
made first and then an incomplete search applied to the searched
invention. In such a case the examiner may send an informal clarification
request for the first invention only and include in the invitation to pay
additional fees remarks on clarity problems related to further inventions.
However, if the complexity lies in lack of clarity, the search will be restricted
firsv and the non-unity objection applied to the clear parts of the claimed
subject matter.
4. Multiple independent claims per category
Multiple independent claims in one category are per se not a reason for an
incomplete search
