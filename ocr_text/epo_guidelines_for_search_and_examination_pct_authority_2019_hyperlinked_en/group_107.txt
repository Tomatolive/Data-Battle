For claims of type (a), (b) or (c), the examiner will search and examine the
claims and assess the novelty and inventive step of the indicated uses, as
is the case for an EP application. In the WO-ISA, a remark will be added
that novelty and inventive step have been assessed according to EPO
practice. The reason for adding this remark is that under Art 54(4) and 15)
EPC it is possible to obtain patent protection for any substance or
composition comprised in the state of the art, for any use or specific use
respectively, in a (medical) method referred to in Art. 53@) EPC, provided
that such use is not comprised in the state of the an. Claims seeking this
kind of protection may be drafted as "Substance X for use as a
medicament/for use in therapy" or 'Substance X for use in the treatment of
disease Y", respectively. See also GI_JEPO G-VL Tl
For claims of type (d) or (h), the examiner will search and examine the
claims and assess the novelty and inventive step thereon as is the case for
an EP application In the WO-ISA, a remark will be added that novelty and
inventive step have been assessed according to EPO practice
For claims of type (i) or (j), the examiner will search and examine the claims
and assess the novelty and inventive step of the indicated uses. In the
WO-ISA a remark regarding EPO practice with regard to such claims will
be added.
For claims of type (e), (f), (g) or (k), in the vast majority of caseS a search
report is established on the basis of the alleged effects of the
product/composition, because their subject-matter can readily and in a
straightfoward manner be understood in terms of these effects. For
reasons of efficiency an opinion on novelty, inventive step and industrial
applicability will be given for (at least) the independent claims, as far as
relating to the alleged effects of the compound/composition, as would be
done for an EP application. A reservation conceming patentability will be
added, indicating that at the EPO claims directed to a method of treatment
or the use of a composition in a treatment are exempted from patentability,
but that a claim directed to a composition or substance for such use would
be admissible
In some cases, no search report can be established for claims of type (e),
(f), (g) or (k), because their subject-matter cannot readily and in a
straightforw•ard manner be understood in terms of the alleged effects of the
Rule 33 31b)
