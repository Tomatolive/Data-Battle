Examiners' Report Paper D 2010 Part II
In this year's paper there were not so many applications or inventions. Hence, the analysis
phase was relatively straightfonnard, but the candidates had to define important strategies
and actions in order to accommodate the client's needs.
The analysis of the existing situation and the application of legal provisions (for example
the steps to request further processing) was generally answered well. However, to achieve
good marks it was also necessary to recognise and propose actions that correspond best
to the client's requirements.
The main points in this years paper were the following:
2.
3.
In the first part it had to be recognised that EPKM does not disclose the structure of
the signal necessary for carrying out the fishing method because it only refers to EPI
Therefore, K.A could render EPKM unpatentable due to a lack of sufficient disclosure
by withdrawing EPI before publication. It had also to be realised that priority from
EPI should not be claimed because then EPI would be made publicly available with
the publication of EP3 (as the priority document in the file of EP3) with the
consequence that the fishing method in EPKM would then be sufficiently disclosed.
Additionally, it was imponant to spot that the disclosure of the fishing method at the
website of KM would, in combination with the structure of the signal as disclosed in
EP3, stop any future patenting of the method.
In improving KA's patent situation in Europe, patent rights from EP3 were necessary.
The repoll of KA became prior art when the filing date of EP3 was changed, so it was
vital to restore the original filing date of EP3 and claim priority from EP2 Most of the
candidates recognised this and proposed the correct procedure to achieve it, [e.
adding a claim to priority from EP2 in EP3 and using the priority document to file the
missing parts (under Rule 56(3) EPC) so that the filing date would not be changed.
However, the first step to take was to withdraw the already submitted missing parts
as an answer to the communication of the EPO
In helping Nonvayfish against Swedishfishi most of the candidates recognised that
the disclosure of EP4 was too general to be novelty destroying against EPF and that
PCTJIJ could be used for a novelty objection in an opposition against EPR Most of
the candidates also recognised that it was still possible to enter the European
regional phase of PCTJU through further processing and the majority proposed the
correct series of steps to take. In order to answer the question correctly it was
necessary to realise that due to the fact that the EPC entered into force in Norway
only on 01.019008, Nonnay was designated in EPF but not in EP4, nor was it
included in the EP designation of PCTJU (EP-PCT JIU). However, under EPC2000,
EP- PCTJU would be prior art for all contracting states (EPF filed after 12/2007, EPC
2000 applies for examination and opposition procedures concerning EPF)_
It is noted that candidates who proposed on the basis of Art 153 (4) EPC and Rule
165 EPC that it was only necessary to request further processing for payment of the
EP filing fee and for filing a translation for PCT.JU in order to make it prior art under
Art 54(3) EPC did not lose marks.
