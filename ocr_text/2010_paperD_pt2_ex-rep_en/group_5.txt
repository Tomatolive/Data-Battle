against EPR KA should accept the offer of JU and have the patent rights of PCTJU
transferred to them.
The time limit for PCTJU to enter EP phase (31 months from filing) ended in December
2009. It is still possible to ask for further processing which should be done within 2 months
from the notification of the communication of loss of rights. The two months end on
1403.2010, extended to 15.03_2010_ With the request for further processing, all the acts
due for entry into the EP phase should be completed and the fee for further processing
should be paid, for each omitted act.
[Pursuant to Art. 153 and Rule 165 EPC it appears sufficient to create prior art under Art.
54(3) EPC if the translation of PCTJU is submitted, the filing fee and the respective fu,'ther
processing fees are paid However; it is advisable in the present case to complete all
omitted acts to enter the EP phase to make sure that the application is published given the
fact that without compliance with the requirements of Rule 159 EPC the application is
deemed to be withdrawn as from expiry of the 31 months' time limit]
In order to enter the EP phase after the expiry of the 31 months time limit, K.A and JU can
act as joint applicants but must act via a professional representative. Alternatively, if the
transfer of rights takes place before the entry in EP phase, KA can act alone but they must
request the registration of the transfer at the EPO upon entry.
Since EP-PCTJU has become prior art under Art 54(3) EPC, an opposition should be filed
against EPF based on lack of novelty. The time limit to file opposition against EPF ends on
09.06_2010_
EPF was filed after January 2008 and therefore is deemed to designate Nonnay, since
Nonnay acceded to the EPC on 01012008. PCTJU on the other hand, was filed before
January 2008 and therefore EP-PCTJU cannot designate Norway.
However, (EPC 2000 apples and) EP-PCTJU will be a prior art document under Art. 54(3)
EPC against EPF for all contracting states, so EPF will be revoked and SF will lose the
protection rights of EPF in all EPC states, including Norway. With EPF revoked, the
infringement proceedings against NF should not be successful.
4. Using patent rights against Swedishfish (SF) (4 marks)
EP4 was also filed before January 2008 and cannot designate Norway.
SF has all its activities based in Nonnay, therefore we can use rights against SF only if we
have patent rights in Noway. Neither EP4 nor EP-PCTJU would give rights in Norvvay and
NF cannot use them against SF.
PCTJU had designated Noway and could have entered the Norwegian national phase
directly However, the time limit to enter the Nonvegian national phase has expired It
should be investigated whether it is still possible to enter the Nonvegian national phase
now. If it is possible to enter Nonnegian phase of PCTJIJ then KA will have a Nonvegian
patent covering material M; SF will be infringing this patent and could be sued/stopped_ If it
is not possible anymore to enter the Norwegian national phase of PCTJU then the use of
material M in Norway will be free for everybody after the revocation of EPF since there will
be no patent right protecting it.
EP4 and EP-PCTJU could be used as prior right against SIV depending on Swedish law.
