In order to use patent rights against Swedishfish, which has all its activities in Nomay,
the client must have patent rights in Nomay
Attention had to be paid to the fundamental issue of checking the countries in which
EP4, PCTJU or EPF may be enforced, thereby realising that, for the reasons
mentioned above, Nonvay could not be designated in EP4 nor in EP-PCTJU_
As a consequence, KA had no patent rights in Nomay that could be used to attack
Swedishfish_ It should, however, be investigated whether an entry into Nonnegian
national directly from PCTJIJ might be possible. Finally, with EPF revoked and no
other patent rights existing in Nonnay, the use of material M would be free there.
