Possible Solution - Paper D 2010 - Part II
1. Stopping KM and everyone else from having a patent for the fishing method (14
marks)
EPI is the first filing for the signal attracting only adult fish. EPKM is the first filing for the
fishing method using this signal.
The public conference and the video presented there are state of the art against EPKM
but since the characteristics of the signal were not disclosed in the video they do not
constitute an enabling disclosure and cannot be considered as relevant prior an.
EPKM discloses the use of the signal for a fishing method, but it does not disclose the
characteristics of the signal necessary to carry out the fishing method since it makes only
a reference to EPI_ For the fishing method claimed in EPKM to be sufficiently disclosed,
EPI must be available at the EPO on the filing date of EPKM (which is the case) and EPI
must be available to the public on or before the date of publication of EPKM
EPI has not been published yet. If publication of EPI is avoided, then the fishing method
of EPKM would be insufficiently disclosed and therefore not patentable. It is possible to
withdraw EPI before publication. Publication of EPI will be in July 2010, so there are still
about 2 months left before the termination of the technical preparations (5 weeks before
publication). EPI should be withdrawn within this time frame so that it will be certain that it
will not be published. In addition, no priority should be claimed from EPI for any further
European patent application (eg EP2, EP3) because after publication of that further
application, which would take place in July 2010 (18 months from priority), the priority
document, i.e. EPI , would be also available to the public as part of the file.
As referenced document EPI will not be available to the public, EPKM will suffer from
insufficiency of disclosure regarding the fishing method which will not be patentable. There
are alternative courses of action at this point: K.A could inform KM that their application
would not be patentable as far as the fishing method is concerned in the hope that they will
withdraw or abandon it or, in the case that EPKM is granted by the EPO, opposition can be
filed against EPKM on the ground of lack of sufficiency of disclosure.
Moreover, the publication of the content of EPKM at the KM website on the day after
EPKM's filing or the publication of EPKM itself in combination with the publication of the
structure and the characteristics of the signal in the report of KA at the end of January
2010 will be enabling prior art against any future application related to the fishing method.
2. Improving KA's patent situation in Europe (23 marks)
EP2 is the first application disclosing the filter Fl and the circuit Cl but the disclosure of
the circuit Cl is not enabling. EP3 is the first enabling disclosure of Cl and the inventive
connection between C and Fl
The public conference and the video on January 20, 2009 cannot be used as prior art
against EP2 or EP3 because the characteristics of the signal or the circuits to produce it
were not disclosed and no enabling disclosure of the signal took place
