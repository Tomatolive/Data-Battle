When/if EPKM is published it would be a prior art document relevant only for novelty (Alt.
54(3) document) against EP2 and EP3, but not relevant because it does not disclose the
nature of the signal or the circuit to produce it
EP2 when/if published will be prior art document under 54(3) EPC relevant only for novelty
against claims 1 and 2 of EP3
EP2 can give KA protection for the filter Fl and the signal but not for the circuit Cl since it
is not sufficiently disclosed. Hence, the only way KA can get protection for Cl is via EP3
However, EP3 has had its filing date moved to 02.022010 after the submission of the
missing parts. The report of KA with EP3 was made available to the public in the library,
even if nobody consulted it, as of end of January 2010. The report will thus be novelty
destroying for EP3 with the new date of filing. In order for KA to be able to get protection
via EP3, it is necessary for EP3 to have a filing/priority date before the end of January
2010.
It is possible to recover the original filing date of EP3
Your request for correction dated 02.022010 should be withdrawn to avod the change of
the filing date. This can be done within 1 month after notification of the communication
under R56 EPC, i.e. until 27.032010, extended to 29.032010. Then EP3 will have a filing
date before the publication of the repoll and the repoll will not be prior art anymore.
It is necessary to introduce the missing parts for sufficiency of disclosure of EP3. This is
possible by claiming the priority of EP2 and requesting their introduction without changing
the filing date.
EP3 was filed within 12 months from the filing date of EP2 which ended on 01.03_2010_ A
priority claim can be added until 16 months from the priority date, i.e. 01.072010
(according to Rule 52 EPC).
KA must request the addition of a claim to the priority of EP2 in EP3 and request
correction (according to Rule 56(3) EPC) in order to introduce the missing pages 6 - 9.
Request for correction is still possible until 12.032010 (i.e. 2 months from filing of EP3).
Therefore, the withdrawal of the missing parts according to your request for correction
dated 02.022010 has to be made before 12.032010, you can not wait until 29.032010.
Neither can you wait for 01.072010 to add priority claim.
Clams to an undenvater camera comprising the circuit Cl and the inventive connection
between Fl and C could be added in EP3 or in a possible divisional patent application.

EPF validly claims priority from Sl , therefore the effective date of EPF is in October 2007.
EP4 is prior art document under Art. 54(3) EPC against EPF_ Since EP4 does not disclose
material M but only the general class G, EPF is new over EP4.
The only document which discloses material M is PCTJLJ. If PCTJU validly enters the
European regional (EP) phase, it would be prior art document under Art 54(3) EPC
