You are a professional representative. On 13 April 1994 you receive the following
letter from your client, professor Karl Smart, who is a famousâ€¢ Danish Biochemist.
As you know have for some years cooperated Vith Dr. Manfred Grisk Vh0 is an
independent researcher and runs a small research laboratory in Copenhagen (DK)
specialising in the development and testing of pharmaceuticals. For each project
a contract is made specifying the purpose of his research and the basic remuner-
ation. The total remuneration for Grisk will be determined by negotiations
between myself and Grisk and will depend on the potential value of any inventions
made. Each contract contains the stipulation that Dr. Grisk assigns to me the
world-vide rights for inventions made In execution Of the project as as the
world wide right to file patent applications on these inventions and that Grisk,
as inventor, should cooperate fully and assist measures necessary for
the obtaining by me of valid protection for these inventions. Each contract also
contains a secrecy agreement which clearly requires Dr. Grisk to keep non-public
information confidential and not to disclose it to third parties. Unfortunately,
we forgot to insert in the contracts a more far reaching clause to the effect
that Dr . Grisk vas not allowed to use information available to him from the
project for his own purposes. Finally, the Maritime and Commercial Court in
Copenhagen (DK) vas specified as the proper venue for disputes arising from the
contracts .
I have prepared the following survey of the various patent application rights
involved and summarised at the end of the survey the problems on which I need
your urgent advice.
Was filed on 3 June 1993 naming myself as applicant and
myself and Dr. Grisk as joint inventors. All formalities have been completed.
The application is based on the invention of Product X which has a hypotensive
e(fect, i.e. lovers the blood-pressure. The only production process disclosed
(Process A) is a rather cumbersome four step process for producing Product X.
Since product X is believed to be novel, I incorporated the folloving independent
claims in the application.
Product X:
Product X for use as a medicament;
Pharmaceutical composition comprising Product X;
Use of Product X for the Production of a hypotensive agent;
Process A.
(Note to candidates: assume that this range of claim kinds is complete so as to
provide optimum protection for inventions of this naturel
It vas solely my suggestion that product X might have a hypotensive effect and
Dr . Grisk developed Process A. Immediately after filing DK 1, I signed a nev
standard contract with Dr. Grl sk under which he was to set up a line of experi-
ments in order to find out whether it was possible to design an improved process
comprising only two process steps. I suggested to Dr. Grisk that by using cer-
tain process parameters steps 1 and 2 of the four step process could be com-
bined, as could steps 3 and
In December 1993 Dr . Grisk had obtained the desired tvo-step process (Process B)
and his process parameters confirmed my suggestions.
