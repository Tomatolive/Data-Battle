I think that PCT 2, which I plan to file Vith the Danish Patent Office as soon
as expedient, should incorporate the whole contents of DK 1 and also a descrip-
tion and claims directed to process B. I have in mind to designate all the
contracting states of the PCT including the USA. Those countries which are also
EPC contracting states should be designated for a European patent.
I personally plan to incorporate in PCT 2 one further feature which I have not
mentioned to Dr. Grisk. By chance, I observed that Product X also appeared to
have an antiviral effect against herpes virus. The tests I have made confirm
this and, moreover, have shown that Product X also has an antiviral effect on
the measles and chicken pox viruses. I believe that it is the first time a
hypotensive agent has also proved to be antiviral, and that this use has great
potential .
To my great surprise, when I met Dr. Grisk yesterday, he told me that he did not
intend to cooperate with me anymore, in particular in securing patent protection,
unless he was adequately remunerated for his time and efforts, which he felt had
not up to now been the case. Also. he astonished me by disclosing that at the
same time as he vas working on Process B, he had also secretly designed a one
step process, Process C, by which a higher yield of Product X could be
obtained than is possible Vith either of the Processes A and B. Process C does
not start from the same materials that are used for Processes A and B for the
production of X and is an entirely different process. However, by process C,
Product X was formed together Vith Product Z as part of a mixture (Product Y) .
He had also separated Product Z from the mixture and tested its possible hypo-
tensive effect on a few rats. It appeared to have a hypotensive effect not
significantly different from the original results obtained Vith Product X.
Dr. Grisk further told me that he had asked another European patent attorney Mr
Mullet to file a European patent application (EP 3). Before filing Mr Mullet had
made an on-line search and found only one reference to product Z, this being in
a Danish journal of 1992 describing its use as a catalyst in a rubber vulcan-
isation process.
Dr. Grisk gave me a copy of EP 3 which vas filed with the Danish Patent Office
on 1 February 1994 designating all EPC contracting states. The application vas
filed in Danish naming Dr. Grisk as the sole applicant and the sole inventor. He
had claimed the priority of 3 June 1993 from DK 1. Dr. Grisk admitted that since
he had not been able to pay Mr Mullet his full charges, no official fees had yet
been paid. I have verified that EP 3, besides the content of DK 1, also contains
a description of the Process B, the Process C for the production of Product Y.
the process for the separation of X and Z from the mixture Y, and finally the
data about the hypotensive effect Of Product Z.
Dr . Grisk also told me that in March 1994 he had contacted the US company
Albatross Inc. and offered them a licence under EP 3 and any subsequent applica-
tions. When I asked him for details, he revealed that as a basis for the negoti-
ations he had given a COPY Of EP 3 to Albatross Inc.
Please give me your advice on the folloving problems. need a memo-
randum. Please also quote the Articles and Rules relevant to the various issues.
For the purpose Of this memorandum, please assume that under Danish the
right to the patent belongs to the inventor but that this right can be assigned
by contract to another party.
