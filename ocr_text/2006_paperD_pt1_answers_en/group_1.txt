Candidate's answer
Paper Dl
Question 1
Yes, you can act before the EPO representing both companies. Under A133(1)
and subject to A1 33(2), no person is obliged to be represented. Both companies
being from EPC states, none is obliged to be represented. Under A133(3),
natural or legal persons having their residence in an EPC contracting state may
be represented by an employee, who need not be a professional representative.
So an employee can definitely act on behalf of Hypertools_ He will require to be
authorised (A133(3), OJ 1991, 489).
Under A133(4), parties acting in common required common representatiom If
common representative not appointed in request for grant (R26(3)), the election
of who is the deemed common representative will be ruled by R 100(1).
So, in order for an employee of Hypertool to be the common representative of
both applicants, it would be necessary to name him as common representative
in Request for Grant to be signed by both applicants (A-IX-I .3)_
Question 2
i)
Yes. A divisional can be filed relating to any pending earlier European
patent application (R25(1))_ Since under A106(1) an appeal has
suspensive effects, the decision to refuse the application is 'frozen"
and one can file a divisional as long as the appeal is pending (see
also A-IV-I.I_I)
