No. EP2 was filed on Feb'03 claiming priority from an earlier Portuguese
national application dated March'02_ From the publications of EP2 and the
Portuguese application in Sept03 we know they disclose the same invention.
So under A87(1), EP2 seems to correctly claim the priority of March'02_ If this
was the case, then EP2 could be prior aft against EPI under A54(3), since it
has been published thereafter under A93, all states are designated, so
designated states are in common with EPI as required under A54(4)
assuming that the designation fees under A79(2) have been validly paid as
required by R23a
