However, in order to be prior an under A54(3) EP2 must be entitled to the
priority date of March'02, so the requirements of A88(1) EPC must be fulfilled. If
this were so, then under ,A89 the priority date shall be considered as the date of
filing of EP2 for the purposes of A54(2) and (3). The requirements for validly
claiming priority in EP2 have been not fulfilled and therefore the priority claim
has been lost
Under A88(1) and R38(3), a copy of the previous application must be filed. Here
not done. Moreover, the applicant did not respond to communication under
R41(1 ) setting a period for responding to this deficiency *consequence: right of
priority is lost under date of EP2 is then Feb'03, which is after
the priority date for EPI (Jan'03), which has been validly is not
prior art under A54(2) nor A54(3) against EPI and thus EPI cannot be revoked
based on EP2_
Question 6
1) The refusal on the request for extension (R84) of the time limit is not a
decision terminating the proceedings and cannot therefore be separately
appealed (A106(3) EPC). The ensuing loss of rights can only be
overcome by requesting further processing under A 121. This should be
done by 21.206 + IOd [R78(2), + 2 months [A121(2),
Wednesday. It would be necessary to pay the fee for
further processing and complete the ommitted act (file a response to the
communication under A96(2)) at the same time (A121(2))_ At the same
time, it is possible to request reimbursement of the fee for further
processing. A decision rejecting the reimbursement of the fee is open to
appeal (J37/8g, see also E-Vlll-1_6)_
