2) No, I would not advise him to do so. Requests for extension under R84
beyond six months, as was desired here, are only granted in certain
special cases. According to E-Vlll-l _6, such special circumstances might
be e.g. a serious illness or the need to conduct further extensive
experiments. Being on holiday on a long trip does not seem to be an
unforeseeable circumstance deserving the grant of exceptional
extensions under R84_
Question 7
Yes. If the proprietor of the patent states that he no longer approves the text in
which the patent was granted and does not submit an amended text, the patent
must be revoked. This is due to the fact that the EPO shall consider and decide
upon the EP patent only in the text submitted or agreed to by the applicant or
proprietor (A11 3(2))_ See also and LA 11/82
