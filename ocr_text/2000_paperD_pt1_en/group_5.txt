Question 9 (4 marks)
A new client informs you that he has an opposition pending against a competitor's
European patent. Claim 1 of this patent as granted contained a limitation to a special,
technically relevant parameter range which provides a technical contribution to the claimed
subject-matter and which had been introduced during the grant procedure by amendment
of claim 1 as originally filed.
In his notice of opposition, your client has demonstrated that the introduced parameter
range was not contained in the application as originally filed, nor was there a basis for
replacing this feature. He asks you what is the likely outcome of the opposition.
Question 10 (5 marks)
The mention of the grant of your client's European patent was published on 26.0599. At
the same time, the specifica•tion of the European patent containing the description and a
set of clams was pub•lished in English; French and German translations of the claims
were included.
No opposition was filed. Today (05.042000), your client informs you that he has just noted
an obvious error in the French translation of the claims filed with the EPO, namely, that
one of the clams has been omitted.
He asks you whether this error can be corrected before the EPO
Question 11 (4 marks)
The applicant for a PCT application received an unfavourable written opinion dated 20
December 1999 pursuant to Rule 66.2 PCT. A three month deadline for response was
given. The PCT application had been filed with the EPO on 16 February 1998 and did not
claim any priorities.
The applicant contacts you today (05.042000) because he is fearful of his application
being rejected and asks you to file arguments and amendments to over•come the
examiner's objections.
What advice would you give your client ?
