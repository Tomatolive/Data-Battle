As evay year, there were some questions which WAI by virtually all candidates, whilst
other questions caused diffculty for many. Comments are given below only on the questions that
were found difficult. However, as a general point, it was clear from the answers on many Of the
qtÄiorB that a Sgnificant number Of candidates were working from Out Of date revision books and
texts. This error can easily lose a candidate the critical marks needed. Once again, a surprisingly high
nurnber of candidates åiled to read questions carefrlly. Many also clearly did not use "time-lines"
when answering appropriate questions.
