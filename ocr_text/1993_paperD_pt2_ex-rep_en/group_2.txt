As the US-app1ication fi led on 30,01.1991 is a continuation application,
the discLosure was the same as that in the US-app1ieation NO. xxx, xxx.
Although this application has been abandoned, this vas after fil ing the
30.01.1991 US-app11catLon and still leaves rights outstanding. Thus the
30.01.1991 US -application Vas not the first application for protection of
the inventions. Therefore, for the PCT-app1ication. no valid priori Ey
claim based on the 30,01.1991 US-app1ication can be made. see Art.
PCT, Art. 4C(4) Paris Convention and Art. 8/(/.) EPC. Hence, pursuant
Art. 89 EPC, the effective date of the PCT-app1ication is Its fi ling date,
30.01.1992.
In order to establish vhether the PCT.app1ication is still pending, tt
should be checkcd vhether the regional phase has been entered correctly,
that ts on 30.10.1992 at the latest under Art. 22 PCT and Rule 104b EPC,
or a demand for an international preliminary examination under Art. 31 (1)
and PCT has duly been filed in arder for Art. PCT to be
applicable, that is on 31 .08.1992 at the latest, because 30.08.1992 vas a
Sunday and the EPO as IPEA vas closed and Art. and Rule 80.5 pc•r
appl ied .
If still pending, observations pursuant to Art. 115 EPC should be fi led in
order to drav the examiner • s attention to the fact that in Viev of the
invalid priority claim, client 's European application eould constitute a
prior application provided that its priori ty claim of 31.01.1991 is val id.
The examiner vill then make an investigation as to the validity of the
priori ty claims, see Guidelines C-V 2. l. rn viev of the fact that the
descriptions, claims and drawings of the Swedish and the EP-applLcation
are identical and the Ep-application has been duly fi led by 31.01.1992 to
claim the priorit:y date, the latter priority claim appears valid, al though
correct fil Lng of the certified copy and translation under Rule 38(3) and
(4) EPC is to be checked.
Consequent:ly, client' s Ep-applieation constitutes a prior application
against the PCT-app1ication for all the EPC Contracttng States, see
Art. 54(3) and (4) EPC. So the contents are prior art for novelty purposes
and as these include the device and the BRIGHT IDEA. C should not get a
European patent for the device or the BRIGHT IDEA.
As the PCT-app1ication has been published, WIPO must furnish A copy of the
priori ty document on request according to Rule 17 .2(c) PCT. Alternatively,
inspection possible USPTO or EPO.
According to Art. 76(1) EPC, a divisional application must be filed at the
EPO in The Hague, Munich or Berlin. It may be that the Svedish Patent
Office has forvarded the divisional application in Viev of Art. 75(3) and
Art. 77 (2) EPC. This should therefore be checked. The date of receipt by
the EPO vould be the date of filing of the divisional application.
Moreover, according to Rule 25(1) EPC, the Of a
application is only valid if the parent application Is still pending. This
should also be checked. The requirement according to Rule 26(2)(e) EPC has
been fulfilled. as the first page of the request is marked "Divisional•.
