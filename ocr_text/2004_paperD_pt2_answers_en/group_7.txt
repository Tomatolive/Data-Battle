In the US, I would check with my associates as to whether ZEUS-EP is available
as prior art, but I do not think it is. As far as I am aware, only applications which are
filed before (but are published after the relevant date) in the US or for the US (i.e.
PCT (US) and then only if they publish in English) count as prior art.
Similarly in JP, I would check with my associates as to whether Zeus-EP is prior
art, but again I do not think that it is. As far as I am aware, only later published,
earlier filed Japanese applications count as prior art.
This means that in the US and JPI claims to the chip should be patentable without
amendment (assuming no further prior act is found).
Freedom to use LEDA's chip.
As ZEUS does not have either a JP or a US patent, LEDA (and KKK) are free to
make and use chips in these countries.
Similarly in Slovakia, Estonia, and Bulgaria, LEDA (and KKK) are free to make
and use the chips This is because ZEUS-EP cannot designate these countries and
you have found no national equivalent applications in respect to these countries.
The situation in the Czech Republic depends on whether CZ-ZEUS is in force or
not If not, then LEDA (and KKK) are free to use and make the chips there. If it is in
force, making and selling and using the chips there would constitute an infringement
of ZEUS-CZ patent
In other EP states - This depends on whether EP-ZEUS has been validated and
brought into force. In most countries this will have required a translation to be filed as
well as paying various fees. I can check with local associates to find out if any
applications are in force yet The deadline for completing these acts is in most
countries 3-months from grant and so will fall in April 2004. Validation can therefore
be monitored.
Chips Already Sold
As the only sale of chips which has occurred was in the US and ZEUS do not
have a patent there, ZEUS cannot do anything about this sale.
Moreover ZEUS are based in Slovakia, thus I would presume that the chips were
made there. As explained above ZEUS also cannot have a patent there, hence there
is nothing ZEUS can do about the manufacture of the chips.
