This would prejudice the allowability of any such application since the public
conference would be prior art against the application for the purposes of both novelty
and inventive step. Since the conference included disclosure of the software as well
as its use in a camera, it would seem that any application having an invalid priority
claim would lack novelty.
On the other hand, the priority is a right of the applicant, therefore for an earlier
application to invalidate the later priority claim based on a later application, the
earlier and later applications must originate from the same applicant Thus any
application filed by Oedipus would be entitled to the priority date for the software
subject matter as well as the digital camera with the software. This affects the filing
strategy which should be used.
3) Considering now the other inventions, the "circuit" was first disclosed in Electra-
Fl. However this is not in Oedipus-EP, therefore no valid priority claim to this subject
matter can be made from Oedipus-EP.
Similarly, the "improved software" was in Electra-EP but not in Oedipus-EP_ So
priority for this subject matter cannot be claimed from Oedipus-EP.
Neither of these subject matter have yet been disclosed and they remain secret,
though it seems that the inventers will discuss this matter in the publication planned.
In light of this forthcoming journal, which will constitute prior art, applications to this
subject matter should be put on file before publication occurs.
The other "invention" is the pocket digital camera. This has not been disclosed in
any application filed thus far.
4)
In light of the above, I would suggest an application claimng priority from
Oedipus-EP is filed by Oedipus-EP in respect of the software and the method of
using the software in image enhancement This application needs to be filed by
30/04/04.
An application should also be filed by Electra claiming priority from Oedipus-EP_
This application should describe and claim: (i) the digital camera with the basic and
improved software and circuit, (ii) the improved software and (iii) the circuit The
priority claim will be valid for the digital camera which will ensure that the disclosure
at the conference does not prejudice patentability. The earlier filed Electra
applications do not cause any problems, as there is no valid priority claim for the
common subject matter
