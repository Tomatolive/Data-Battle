ZEUS/LEDA
STATUS OF LEDA-PCT
(a) This application has a filing date of >0012/03 and a valid priority to an application
dated xx/ 12/02 This means that the effective date of all of the subject matter in
LEDA-PCT is the priority date i.e. m 12/02.
(b) The application designates EP, JP and US. The application was filed in
December 2002 which means that the EP designation includes all of those states for
which the EPC entered into force during 2002 (as well as all the earlier contracting
states of course'). Those dates for which the EP entered into force under A 169 EPC
during 2002 include: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovakia That the EPO
can act as designated office for an international application filed on or after the date
on which the EPC came into force is clear from J 30/90.
(c) Possible prior art against LEDA-PCT.
(i) The sales to KKK.
These sales occurred in April 2002, which is after the priority date, but before the
filing date of LEDA-PCT. The priority clam is, however, valid (see ie char (a))
therefore these sales will not be effective prior art against any of the subject
matter in LEDA-PCT.
ZEUS-EP
This application published in May 2002, which is after the priority date, but before the
filing date of LEDA-PCT. This means that ZEUS-EP cannot be full prior art citable for
novelty and inventive step, as the publication did not occur until after the effective
date of the claims (ie the priority claim is valid).
However, ZEUS-EP may be citable for novelty only, though the position in this
regard is likely to be different in the different states designated in LEDA-PCT
