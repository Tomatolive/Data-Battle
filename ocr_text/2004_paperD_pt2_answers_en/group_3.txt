In order for Oedipus and Electra to both be able to claim priority in the suggested
way it may, depending on how the assignment which is already executed is worded,
be necessary to make a fufther assignment from Electra to Oedipus, transferring
back the right to claim priority from Oedipus-EP insofar as it relates to the software
and the method of image enhancement.
An agreement should also be established between the parties such that Oedipus
assigns back the application(s) filed in his name after filing.
5) Of the countries which Electra are interested in all are members of the PCT, with
the exception of Taiwan. Thus in Taiwan, one application should be filed as
described above in (4) by Oedipus and one filed by Electra as described in (4). As
Taiwan is a member of the Paris Convention it will recognize the priority claims
based on Oedipus-EP
With regard to the PCT applications, USA, EP, JP and South Korea can all be
designated. As these international applications will be filed after 01/07/02, when the
EPC entered into force in the Czech Republic, it can be obtained by the EP
designations. That the EPO can act as designated office in international applications
filed on or after the date on which the international application was filed was
confirmed by J 30/90.
In respect of the US designations on these applications, Oedpus and Electra
cannot be named as applicants as it is required that the applicant is a natural person.
In respect of the software/image enhancement application Ms Myopia should be
named as applicant (and her rights assigned hereafter). In respect of the camera,
software and circuit PCT application, both Miss Myopia and Dr Panopticon should be
named as applicants (and their rights assigned hereafter).
6) The application to be filed in the name of Oedipus/Miss Myopia cover the
software and the method of image enhancement Whether this subject matter is
patentable may vary from state to state â€” the method of image enhancement is
probably acceptable in all states, but whether claims to the software per se will be
allowable everywhere is less clear. The US will probably allow such claims. In
Europe claims to a programme for a computer are excluded under A 52(2)(c)
though Art 52/3 provides that this exclusion only applies to the extent that the
application relates to a programme as such.
