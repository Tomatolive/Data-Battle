In the EP designation, ZEUS-EP will be novelty only prior art under A 54(3) EPC in
those states which are commonly designated and in respect of which the designation
fees have been paid (C 23a EPC). In this case this cannot include Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Estonia or Bulgaria (and possibly more). This is because ZEUS-EP was
filed in November 2001, which is before any of these states joined the EPC_ Hence it
would have been impossible for these states to have been designated in ZEUS-EP
That this was the case is confirmed by J 14/90.
Possible CZ-ZEUS
If such an application exists this will not be citable prior act against the EP
designation of LEDA-PCT under A 54(3). This is because A 54(3) specifically relates
to earlier filed "european applications", and not to earlier national applications.
Effects of Prior Art in EP application
Situation 1 - There is no CZ-ZEUS.
In those states which are not designated in ZEUS-EP (and for which designation
fees were not paid) claims to the chip can be maintained. This will at least included
those states mentioned above which joined the EPC in 2002 and most significally it
will include Slovakia and Czech Republic.
In other states for which designation fees were paid in ZEUS-EP, an amendment
will probably need to be made to the claims to ensure that they are novel over ZEUS-
EP. If an amendment can be made, then it is possible to have two different claim
sets comprising the application for different states (if such an amendment is
necessary and is not possible, then it will not be possible to obtain a patent for the
chip in these states).
Situation 2 - A CZ-ZEUS exists.
In this case the situation for Slovakia is the same. Also the situation in any other
state, other than the Czech Republic is the same.
However if a ZEUS-CZ exists it may be that it is not possible to secure a patent in
the Czech Republic. This is because although earlier national applications are not
citeable under A 54(3) EPC, they are earlier prior rights against European Patents (A
139(2) EPC)_ This means that such an application could be used to a revoke a CZ
patent deriving from LEDA-PCT. There is a facility provided by R. 87 EPC for
bringing such prior national rights to the attention of the EPO during examination,
and it will be allowable in this case to file an amended claim set in respect of CZ if
such an amendment is available to make.
