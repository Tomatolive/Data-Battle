Presumably the chips have been incorporated into cameras by KKK. However,
KKK have only to date sold cameras incorporating the chips in the US, where ZEUS
do not have a patent. Thus the sale of these cameras does not constitute an
infringement and ZEUS cannot do anything.
On the other hand, KKK should not for the time being sell any cameras
incorporating the chips in any of those EP states where ZEUS-EP could be validated.
Such a sale could constitute a direct infringement by KKK and an indirect
infringement by LEDA, since they have supplied the essential means for putting the
invention into effect
(g) Improving the situation
A new application should be filed by LEDA directed to the chip modified to include
the image enhancement circuit. This application should be patentable since a major
improvement in performance is achieved. There does not appear to be any prior art
describing use of such a circuit in a chip.
This application should be filed on the same day or after the application of Electra
directed to the circuit. This will then ensure that the chip incorporating the circuit is
sufficient In fact a copy of the PCT application describing the circuit should be filed
along with this new application.
Once this application is filed, LEDA will be in a strong position to negotiate X-
licence with ZEUS. LEDA has the rights to the original chip in the US, JP and
Slovakia (and possibly others) as well as an application to the improved chip. On the
other hand, ZEUS have the earliest application in some EP contracting states and
possibly CZ (this should be established before the negotiations are begun).
Thus I would suggest that LEDA seek a deal wherein LEDA and their licencees
(LEDA can grant a licence to KKK) are permitted to make, use and sell the original
chip in Europe (all CS) in retum for granting ZEUS a licence to use the new chip in
for as few EPC CS as they will accept Ideally, this would not extend to the US and
JP - then LEDA and KKK would have exclusivity in these jurisdictions.
(h) What to tell KKK
(i) f KKK buy chips form ZESU rather than LEDA, then they will be able to sell their
cameras incorporating the chips freely in those EP states where EP-ZEUS has been
validated and in force. This does not include Slovakia, Bulgaria or Estonia.
