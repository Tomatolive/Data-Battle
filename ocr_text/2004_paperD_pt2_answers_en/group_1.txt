ELECTRIC OPTICS/OEDIPUS
l)
Electra filed two applications in 1997, Electra Fl and Electra-EP_ Clearly more
than 12 months have passed since these applications were filed, thus it is not
possible to claim priority from either of these applications (A 4(1)PC)_
It is, nevertheless, important to consider what these earlier applications
described.
Electra-Fl was the first application filed in the name of Electra to the basic
software and a circuit for performing the software ("circuit'). Also, this application
was used as the priority application in Electra-EP (under A 87(1 )EPC). Electra-EP is
the first application filed in the name of Electra to the improved software.
Neither of these applications will be prior art against any later filed application as
they were withdrawn before publication. Their content is, however, relevant for
determining whether any priority claims made from Oedipus-EP are valid.
2) Oedipus-EP was filed on 30/04/03, therefore a priority claim can be made from
this application up until 30/04/04. This deadline has not passed therefore there is still
time to file one or more applications making this priority claim.
The Oedipus application describes a digital camera carrying the software. This
subject matter was not described in either of Electra's earlier applications of 1997,
therefore Oedipus-EP is the first application filed to this subject matter.
The other subject matter disclosed in Oedipus-EP is the software and its use in
image enhancement. The software and, as I understand page 1 , paragraph 2, line 4,
use of the software in image enhancement was, however, first described in Electra-
Fl. This means that any claim to priority to this subject matter bv Electra must be
based on the earlier Finnish application for it to be valid, unless the requirements of
ART 4c(4) have been met This would not, however, appear to be the case because
the Finnish application has served as a priority claim in Electra's EP application.
This means that if Electra were to ty and claim priority from Oedipus-EP the
priority claim would be invalid insofar as it relates to the software.
