They may also be protected in Czech Republic - depending on whether CZ-ZEUS
has been maintained and is in force.
On the other hand, they will not be free to sell the cameras incorporating the chip
in the US, JP or Slovakia, since LEDA have patent applications of the earliest date in
these countries. Although it is not often possible to be sued under an application,
these will eventually become patents and KKK would be an infringer. The damages
would be payable back to the date of publication of the application. This follows from
the fact that ZEUS application is identical to LEDAs and presumably covers their
commercial product
As KKK have already started selling and have established a market there, I would
have assumed that their US market is the most important to them. I would point this
out
To summarize, KKK have the choice of the EP market (by buying from ZEUS) or
the US and JP markets (from buying with LEDA). I would imagine (and hope) the
latter is more attractive to KKK
Additionally, I would inform KKK of my plans to seek a cross-licence with ZEUS I
would indicate that LEDA had a new application to file (without disclosing any details)
and that we were hopeful that this could result in a cross-licence with ZEUS wherein
LEDA and KKK could buy and sell chips and cameras incorporating chips in EP, in
return for allowing ZEUS some freedom to use the subject matter of the new
application. I would make it clear that I would hope to not have to use the US and JP
patent applications (in the PCT) as part of this deal in order that LEDA and KKK
keep these markets to themselves.
