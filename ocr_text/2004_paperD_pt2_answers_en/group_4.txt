Moreover the recent case law of the EPO shows that a computer program will be
patentable (assuming it meets the other criteria of novelty, inventive step etc.) if it
has technical character. This technical character may be derived from a technical
effect which is produced by the program when it is run on the computer Hence the
image enhancement which is provided will constitute such an effect (following T
1173/97).
7) With regard to the subject matter in the applications filed by Electra, I would note
that it is not unforeseeable that a disvorcity objection would arise and that it is
considered that the camera, the circuit and the software represent three inventers. If
this occurs, this can be overcome by filing one or more divisional applications in the
national phases. The PCT does not currently provide for filing of divisional
applications.
8) With regard to EP-Oedipus which is currently pending, I would suggest that this
can be allowed to lapse. Art 47(B) PC provides that an application need not be active
in order to claim priority from it, therefore this will not effect the validity of the priority
claims.
If it is maintained, rather than pursuing the EP designation of the PCT
applications, then the term of protection is effectively reduced by 1 year. This is
because the term is 20 years from the filing date (Art 3? EPC). In the case of EP-
Oedipus, the filing date is 30/04/03, whereas in the PCT applications this is moved to
April 2004.
9) The final outstanding issue is the recordal of the transfer of EP-Oedipus_ I do not
suggest this is done. The EP register entry for this case is not created till after
publication, therefore it would not be able for anyone to see.
Also, so long as appropriate assignments are in place to ensure the priority
claims are valid as discussed in point (4) above, the right to claim priority is effective.
Copies of these assignments can be provided to any national offices which require
them. The International Bureau is unlikely to raise this issue.
