such a valid right since there are feat:ures now presented as
essential in their application which were not present in the
Gerrnan patent Application (T65/87 and T81/87) . Their European
Application i s only entitled to its fil ing date 31.08.90
whereas yours is entitled to its priority date of 10.01.90.
Thus you have " first rights• (putting rather casual Iy) .
As noted above, the effect of this • first right • Is dependent
inter alia on publication. Your application Should publish in
June. The published application will have no effect on X • s EPA
since publication will be later than the date Of fil ing Of
that application. However, under Art. 54 (3) your unpublished
application is relevant to the novelty of x • s EPA because your
priori ty date is before their fil ing date (which is all they
can validly claim as noted above) . This is only true by
Art. 54 (4) for the countries which are corwnonly designated,
i.e. CH. DE. FR, GB. that is, in so tar as x 'S EPA covers NL,
your EPA has no effect thereon. If this is drawn to the
Examiners Of x 's EPA attention, by I would suggest making
"observations" under Art. 115 on x 's EPA now if published or
when it Publishes, the Examiner will cite your application and
force X to limit theirs to distinguish it therefrom. They will
therefore not be able to Cover the subject matter which they
first disclosed in EPA i . e. the specific terverature range and
time. You only will be able to obtain protection for this in
the countries in which you are interested. Because Of
Art. 54 (4) your application only affects x 's in the corrnonly
designated states, they will be able to protect the method
with the selected ternps in the NL but presumably this Will not
upset You. However they do this you will be able to proceed
with your application and they will not be able to protect the
method in the countries in which you are interested.
please note that X • S EPA if this has published has no effect
on your application since the publication will have been after
both the fil ing and priori ty date Of your application.
If there was any disclosure by x, after fi ling their German
application it should not affect you since I believe your
claims are novel over the broad range X original Iy disclosed,
as a select ion TI 98/84.
Your member of staff is the inventor of invention B and under
Art. 60 (1) as his employer you have the right to a European
patent for the invention. Y have no such rights. You Zold
them, via your staff mernber, about invention B in confidence
and this irnplies that they had no right to use the invention
or disclose it to others. Further your tel ling them about it
gives them no right to a patent for it since that right
belongs to the inventor or his legal successor in title only.
I therefOre think that you could bring a case against Y on the
basis that you are entitled to the grant of the patent. By the
Protocol On Recognition Article 2 the case would have to be
brought in Sweden since that is where Y is resident. To be
successful you would have to show clearly how Y •obtained• the
invention from you and we would need a declaration from your
staff merrber. The statement by Y, which I presume is in
