are not entitled.
Once proceedings are conunenced, we can give not Of them to
the European Patent Office. It we do so R. 13 (1) they Will
then suspend proceedings on Y • s application since it has
Published on Y will be unable to withdraw (R. 14) . We Ought
to move quickly to get this bar on withdrawal in place. Also
we must watch the renewal fees since these are not suspended

If you are successful in the Swedish Courts then by Art. 9 of
the Protocol of Recognition their decision will have to be
recognised by the courts of all other Contracting States. Thus
Success will put you in a position Of havi ng a final decision
recognised or which will be so in all the states designated in

For

its
application. You then have three options. You can :
prosecute application in his place Art. 61 (1) (a) ,
file a new application in respect of the invention Of Y 's
application, Art. 61 (1) (b)
request that Y • s application will be withdrawn,
Alt. 61 (1)
all Of these options, you muse do them within 3 months of
final decision in the Swedish Court, Art. 61 (1) .
application has published and therefore you cannot prevent
effect under Art. 54 (3) (as explained re. BI) on your
application which is Of a later date. Thus option c would be
point Iess, since will achieve
Option b is expensive and I believe unnecessary since you will
not: gain anything except an earlier date for some only of the
countries in which you are interested.
The new application would only be able to cover embodiment one
and could on Iy designate the countries which Y original Iy
designated (Art. 61 (1) and Art. 76 (1) as applied by
Art. 61 . Thus all you would get is protection for
embodiment one in CH. DE, PR, GB, SE.
Option a is the best to rrv mind. You Will then have Y • s
application to protect one embodiment Of your two in CH. DE,
FR, GB and SE. You will not be able to protect that embodiment
in your appl i cation tor those countries (because Of the
effects of Y 's application under Art. 54 (3) and (4)) but you
Can still protect it therein for BE and NL since Y • s
application will have no effect in relation to these
(Art. 54 (4)) . You can also continue with your application for
the second embodiment for all states originally disclosed
since this is apparently novel in light of the disclosure Of
Y' s application which is all that is required because theirs
was not Published une il atter your date of filing.
The steps for now therefore are to open proceedings and have
proceedings on Y • s application suspended. For the future take
over the prosecution of Y • s application and limit yours so
