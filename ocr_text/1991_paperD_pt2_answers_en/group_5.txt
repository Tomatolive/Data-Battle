C.
that Claims directed to embodiment one exist only for BE and
NL under R. 87. You may possibly also have to file a
divisional for embodiment two since there does not Seem to be
any uni ty Of invention between this and embodiment one as
required by Art. 82.
By Art. 79 (2) the designation tees on a European Patent
Application are due on the latest of eieher 12 months from
priority or one month from filing. In your case the latest is
12 montha from priority, i.e. by 26.01.91. This was a Saturday
so the fees were not actually due till the following Monday
28. 01 . 91. You did not designate any Contracting States in the
requese. The effect of this is that you dispensed with
notification under R. 85 (a) (1) and simply had 2 months from
the original due date to pay the designat:ion fees for those
countries to be protected with a fine (equal by Art. 2 (3) (b)
RRF to 50t of the relevant fees) . This is an aggregate time
limit which expires 28.03.91 (LA NO. 5) .
Your money order was deposited on the 18 . 03 . 91. This was ten
days before the due date (following the way days are to be
counted as per R. 83 Thus by Art. 8 (3) (a) RRF since you
effected pafinent in a Contracting State ten days before the
due date your payrnent is deerned received in time even though
in fact rnade late. Thus you have paid 3640 DM in time.
However, this would have covered 13 designaeions at the
standard rate, not however when the fine is added for late
payrnent .
By J23 / 82 when parment is not enough for designations
Art. 9 (2) RRF is be applied following consultation with the
client (if necessary) . Article 9 (2) states that the fees
should be used to pay for the designations Of the States in
the order you have put them plus fine until there is
insuffieient for a full designation.
Therefore they Will al Iow you 9 designations (z 2520 DM + a
rnaximum fine of 1100) since these will all be covered by the
money you have pai d. Luckily given the order you Choose this
will mean the countries you did not want will not be covered.
You will receive a notification trom the EPO R. 69 (1) to this
effect .
Please let me have any instructions re. B2 .
