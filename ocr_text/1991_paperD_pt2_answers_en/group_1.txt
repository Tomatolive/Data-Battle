Dear Sirs,
1 will deal with each of your questions in turn in the order given
in your letter:
A. The decision was sent t 0 you on 14.11.90. Since you are
resident in a Contracting State the EPO deem you to have been
notified ten days later i.e. 24.11.90 (R. 78 Since this
ten day period is not a time limit, its end is not affect ed by
weekends or "dies non" i . e. R. 85 (1) does not apply and so the
fact that the 24 .11. 90 was a Saturday has no effect .
The time limit for fil ing an appeal notice and paying the fee
therefore is 2 months from the notification of the decision
(Art. 108). Thus the time limit expired on 24.01.91 (R. 83
You fil ed the appeal notice and submitted a cheque to the EPO,
I presume from your letter directly. on the 23 . 01. 91 and
therefore met the time 1 imit, in particular since cheques
actually fil ed at the EPO provided they are met mean that
Payment is made on the date they are handed over Art. 8 (1) (c)
Article 108 a ISO gives a period of 4 months for fi ling the
statement of grounds for the appeal. This takes us to the
24 . 03 . 91 but since this is a Sunday, as your patent expert
said, the grounds were due on 25.03 . 91 (R. 85 (1) ) .
