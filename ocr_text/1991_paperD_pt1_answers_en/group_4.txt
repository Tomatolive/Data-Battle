the requirements for registering a transfer Of a European
patent Application and so R. 61 means that a transter of a
patent in the stated periods can also be registered.
The requirements for registration Of the transfer are that an
original or certified copy of a document showing the transfer
must be produced R. 20 (1) . That document must bear the
signatures of both parties to the contract Are. 72. Final ly a
tee must be paid R. 20 (2) (the arnount Of which is laid down by
the President under Art. 3 RRF) . The EPO must then register
the R. 20 (2) .
R. 20 applies to A, B and C. It also applies by virtue of R. 61
to D since this is still in the Opposition Period which by
Art. 99 (1) runs for 9 months trom the date Of grant i . e. une il
30.11 . 91 and in fact by R. 85 (1) since that is a Saturday
until the 02.12.91. Thus fil ing by 01.07 . 91 or shortly
thereafter should ensure registration by the end of the
opposition period .
R. 20 also applies to G by virtue Of R. 61 since the fil ing Of
the appeal Prevents the Opposition proceedings from beinq
final Iy closed (Art. 106 (1) an appeal has a suspensive
effect) [also applied by R. 66 (1) which applies provisions of
the department which made the decision from which the appeal
is brought to the appeal proceedings. Thus by R. 66 R. 61
applies and therefore in turn R. 20 applies) .
EFG are outside their opposition periods and therefore will
have to be deal t with by the national German procedure .
The Enlarged Baard Of Appeal decision GO 1/ eg states that an
opposition can be transferred together with a transferral Of a
business or the pare thereof in the interests Of which the
opposition was filed. Thus Since he has taken over the whole
firm the Opposition has also been transferred and he Can
proceed with it .
However, by R. 56 (1) an opposition is to be rejected as
inadmissible unless by the end of the opposition period the
requirements of inter alia R. 1 (1) are complied with. R. 1 (1)
States that the opposition must be in an EPO official language
i . e. English, French or German. The On Iy derogation from this
is if the Opponent is entitled by national ity or residence to
use another language i . e. an Official language Of one Of the
Contracting States (Art. 14 (2) Art. 14 in which Case the
opposition could be fi led in such a language and follow up by
a translation (time limit R. 6 (2)). This only applies to the
opponent, not his representative T149/85 and therefore the
requirements of R. 1 (1) have not been fultilled. It is too
late to do so and the opposition must be rejected as
inadmissible .
