The proposed European Patent Application can claim priori ty
trom the Japanese Utility Model, Art. 87 and must be f iled
within 12 months of the date of fil ing of that utility model
i . e. in 9 months time. [Japan is a Paris Convention country
and Art. 4E (2) of that Convention specifically States that a
utility model can claim priori ty from a patent application and
vice—versa. The priori ty period for both patents and utility
models is 12 months Art. 4C(1) PC] .
The national industrial design applications can also claim
priori ty from the Japanese utility model applications but by
Art. 4E (1) PC the period of priori ty is that Of industrial
designs i.e. by Art. 4C(1) PC 6 months. Thus the new
applications would have to be on file within 3
If the aesthetic Eeatures were produced by some new technical

notice has been given that the witness Will use English
at least one month before the date of the Oral
Proceedings R. 2 (1) . If was to use Swedish the clients
would be responsible for interpretation. R. 2 (1) .
The employee eould also represent his Company at that
Oral proceedings provided that he had an authorisation,
Art. 133 (3) . In this case he need not be a professional
