Sadly-Resources Limited had a research programme on Ways Of purifying proteins. The research was
carried out on a mixture of proteins obtained from brewer's yeast. A special process was developed
by which each of the proteins in the mixture was isolated. The isolated proteins were shown to be
pure and to have activity as a fermentation promoter. Sadly-Resources Limited are not aware Of any
prior art related to the isolated proteins.
A European patent application PROT-EUI was filed on 14 January 1997 disclosing the results of the
research and having a single claim. The claim is directed to the isolation process per se. It is not limi-
ted to any specific mixture of proteins. Because the search report revealed large amounts Of prior art
related to the process, designation fees were paid for the UK, France and Germany only. No applica-
tions were filed claiming priority from PROT-EUI.
A communication from the Examining Division dated 4 September 1999, and giving four months to
respond, indicated that it intended to refuse the application. Sadly-Resources Limited requested a
two-month extension, but did not file a response because it felt that the process as claimed did not
have sufficient value to warrant the expense Of continuing.
