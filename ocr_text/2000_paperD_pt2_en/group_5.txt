In an article from the American Air Force published last week and describing research work carried
out in 1999, details are given Of a protein which reduces the symptoms Of jet lag. This protein is one
of those isolated in the Sadly-Resources Limited work and is described in PROT-EU l, in which it is
called SAD-PROT. A patent for SAD-PROT and its method of isolation would clearly be commer-
cially very valuable.

Will it be possible to get valid patents in all the EPC contracting states for the isolaâ€¢
tion process in general and for SAD-PROT itself, and if so, what actions should be
taken in the next six months?
What would be the consequences if the American Air Force have med patent applica-
tions for their work - could they get a European patent and could they stop your em.
ployer selling SAD-PROT?
SAD-ENZ
SAD-ENZ is an enzyme which was discovered as a result Of collaboration between Sadly-Resources
Limited and the Fat-Cat Research Institute in Munich. Fat-Cat carried Out the preparation and testing
of enzymes at the request of Sadly-Resources Limited. SAD-ENZ has been found to inhibit the depo-
sit and accumulation of fat cells in mammals. Thus there is a potentially huge market for it as a slim-
ming aid for humans and their pets.
The collaboration agreement between Fat-Cat and Sadly-Resources Limited allows both parties to file
patent applications for inventions made by their employees without reference to the other party.
