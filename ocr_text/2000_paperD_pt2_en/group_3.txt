SAD-FORM
SAD-FORM is a pharmaceutical formulation for administering therapeutic amounts of any pharma-
ceutical to human beings and animals. The production Of this formulation involves encapsulating a
few molecules of the pharmaceutical in a minute soap bubble. The formulation is applied by spraying
the soap bubbles into, for example, the lungs, from where the pharmaceutical is absorbed.
A national patent application, FORM-UKI , describing SAD-FORM, its production and its use in
great detail, was filed at the UK Patent Office on 24 July 1998.
The inventors given for FORM-UKI are Dr Fairy, the research director of Sadly-Resources Limited,
and Professor Blowit from I.Ã…)ndon University. 'ne file contains a copy of a research agreement bet-
ween Sadly-Resources Limited and Professor Blowit, assigning all rights in his inventions to Sadly-
Resources Limited. The agreement indicates that Professor Blowit may not disclose any information
on the research until after a patent application is filed.
A European patent application, FORM-EU2, claiming priority of FORM-UKI was filed at the UK
Patent Office on 26 July 1999. FORM-EU2 also includes a further embodiment of the invention
called SAD-FORW2. However, SAD-FORW2 is not disclosed in FORM-UKI. SAD-FORW2 is
commercially very important, NO other applications were filed.
Very recent work at Gobbleup indicates that the soap bubbles. particularly those used in the embodi-
ment SAD-FORM/2, can unexpectedly be made more stable and effective if the pharmaceutical they
contain is mixed with an Oil. Clearly, if this is correct. the inventions. particularly the embodiment
SAD-FORM/2, will be very valuable. The inventions need to be protected as widely as possible but
bearing in mind that it will take about 18 months to assess the commercial value of the inventions.
