The Sadly-Resources attorney filed a European patent application ENZ-EU with the UK Patent Of-
fice on 12 April 1999 without claiming priority. Dr Plump, an employee, is named as inventor and
Sadly-Resources as applicant. The filing fee and search fee were paid by deposit account debit order
enclosed with the application docurnents. ENZ-EU discloses the enzyme Structure and its activity,
together with details Of how to administer it to humans and animals. ENZ-EU does not include any
information on how to prepare SAD-ENZ
An attorney acting for Fat-Cat also filed a European application FAT-EU, in his case directly with the
EPO in Munich on 7 April 1999, but he has paid no fees on the application. 'Ille application claims a
novel and inventive high-yield process for the preparation Of the enzyme. It describes the enzyme's
structure, but not its activity. application names Mr Puss, director Of the Institute, as inventor and
Fat-Cat as applicant.
Fat-Cat have written to say that they do not wish to continue with their application and would be hap-
py to assign to Sadly-Rcsources Limited all rights in and derivable from the patent application FAT-
EU; all they would like in consideration of the assignment is a single payment Of one million euros.
The search report produced by the EPO for ENZ-EU includes two citations. One is a newspaper re-
port dated 9 April 1999 of an interview the previous day with Mr Puss in which he discusses the pre-
paration and structure of the enzyme but does not disclose its activity. The second citation is a PCT
application in the name of Gene-Genie Inc. The PCT application had been filed in the USA in 1996
without claiming priority, designating all PCT member States. The application includes the structures
Of a huge number Of enzymes and their preparation and isolation using a low-yield process. One Of
the enzymes described in the PCI' application is now known to be SAD-ENZ. No use or any activity
is described for any of the enzymes and we have been told by Gene-Genie that neither the European
regional phase nor the US national phase was entered.
