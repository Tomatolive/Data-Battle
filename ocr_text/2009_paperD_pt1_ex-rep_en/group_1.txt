Examiners' Report Paper D 2009 Part I
On the positive side, many candidates were generally showing a satisfactory knowledge of
the individual relevant provisions and their sources. Neveftheless in some cases, out of
date references were used. These candidates unnecessarily lost marks.
On the other hand, still too many candidates were losing marks for not showing that they
can apply the law to the particular facts of the case. In particular, candidates are reminded
that the purpose of paper Dl is to check their knowledge of the legal texts and how to
apply the provisions to a panicular set of facts. Hence, the given answer inevitably has to
be suppofted with a citation of the relevant legal basis. Furthermore, it is important that
candidates do not merely reproduce the wording of a legal provision but that they actually
relate it to the facts presented in the question. Similarly, a simple reproduction of portions
of the question also does not lead to marks.
Candidates are also reminded to cite the most relevant legal basis. For example, if an
Article or Rule of the EPC is the most relevant provision to support an answer, then citing
passages from the brochure "How to get a European Patent" is not sufficient
Specific Remarks:
Question 1:
The question was generally well answered In part b, some candidates wrongly considered
that filing amendments is to be considered as filing of documents which have to be filed
within a time Imit and thus tried to apply Article 14(4) EPC.
Question 2
Relatively few candidates actually discussed the consequences of filing the opposition in
each of the presented options in view of the planned transfer of company B to company C.
Question 3
The question was generally well answered Most of the candidates recognized that a
divisional application had to be filed and that the designation of Ireland in EP-I had to be
recovered _
Question 4
Some candidates did not use the latest version of the applicable schedule of fees resulting
in a wrong reasoning. Moreover, many candidates were not aware that the EPO will debit
the correct amount because the purpose of the payment was clearly indicated.
