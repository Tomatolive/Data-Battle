Question 5
Many candidates failed to clearly distinguish the language requirements for filing
amendments, for filing requests, such as the demand for international preliminary
examination or the request for examination, and for submitting other correspondence or
further documents with the relevant authority. Moreover, many candidates failed to
concretely respond to whether Romanian or English may be used for the different types of
submissions. Some candidates wholly ignored the provisions of the PCT for the
international phase by citing from the EPC instead.
Question 6
This question was generally very well answered. For part b, some candidates did not
recognize that the registration of the exclusive licence is not possible because there is no
consent from company B. Moreover, some marks were lost when candidates failed to
mention that only an interested party is entitled to file a request for registration of a licence.
Question 7
This question was generally well answered. Many candidates did not cite Rule 81(1 ) EPC,
which states that new grounds of opposition may still be examined by the opposition
division of its own motion if they would prejudice the maintenance of the European patent
Question 8
Quite a number of candidates seemed unaware that the date on which a fee is due is
generally the first day on which it is payable, not the last, see Guidelines A-XL Moreover,
candidates overlooked that the designation fee and the examination fee are in fact due on
the date of filing the divisional application due to the use of Form 1001 where examination
is automatically requested.
Question 9
This question was answered very well by those who applied and cited the relevant
transitional provision.
