- Paper D 2009 - Part I
Answer to question 1:
a) Yes, according to Article 14(2) EPC, European patent applications may be filed in any
language, thus in Italian by a GB national living in UK Translation of EP-I in an official
EPO language is required.
b) No, amendments for EP-2 must be filed in the language of the proceedings, Rule 3(2)
EPC. The language of the proceedings is the one in which the application was filed, Article
14(3) EPC. Here, this is French.
c) No, a GB national living in the UK does not enjoy the language privilege under Article
14(4) EPC and should have filed the opposition in DE, EN or FR, Rule 3(1) EPC_ Thus, the
opposition to EP-3 is deemed not to have been filed, Article 14(4) EPC_
Answer to question 2:
Filing the opposition in the name of A alone: Even though it is possible to file the
opposition in the name of company A alone, this is not advisable because it is not possible
to transfer an opposition filed in the name of company A to another company, G2/04_
Filing the opposition in the name of B alone: Not being an employee of company B, you
cannot validly file an opposition in the name of company B alone, Article 133(3) EPC
Filing a joint opposition: Joint opposition is possible according to G3/99. It is the advisable
approach in this situatiom By this procedure, company B is joint opponent and will remain
so even after being sold to company C. In the case of a joint opposition of A and B, no
professional representative is needed since both companies have their place of business
in one of the contracting states, Alticle 133 EPC, and company B remains joint opponent
after sale to company C. In the case of joint opposition you, i.e. as an employee of A, can
be the representative provided that A is common representative either by explicit
statement in the notice of opposition or the first named opponent, Rule 151(1) EPC, G
3/99. Signatures of A and B are required but can be submitted later.
Answer to question 3:
Since the separate invention is not unitary with the claims of EPI , the applicant A has to
file a divisional application claming the separate invention, Alticle 76(1) EPC, Guidelines
C-VI g. 12 or C-lll TIO, last paragraph. For the divisional application to designate Ireland,
IE has to be designated in EPI according to Article 76(2) EPC
According to Rule 39(1) EPC, the time limit for the payment of designation fees is six
months from the publication of the search report of EPI, which expires on 13 February
2009 (Friday). On 3 March 2009, it is too late to pay the designation fees for IE for EPI
according to Article 79(2) EPC_ Therefore, the designation for IE is deemed to be
withdrawn according to Rule 39(2) EPC
