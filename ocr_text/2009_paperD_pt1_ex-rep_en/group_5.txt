Answer to question 9:
Although according to Article 76(1 ) EPC the divisional is deemed to have been filed on the
date of filing of the earlier application, the date of receipt of the divisional application
determines the applicability of the EPC2000, Notice from the EPO, 20 September 2007,
OJ 10/2007 page 504 or Alticle 7(1) Revision Act or Article 1(1) Transitional Provisions.
Therefore, Alticle 54(3) EPC2000 applies. The divisional application was made pending
only after entry into force of EPC2000.
Consequently, Dl is novelty destroying under Article 54(1) and (3) EPC2000 for the
subject-matter of all claims of the divisional application for all contracting states D2 is still
novelty destroying according to Alticle 54(2) EPC2000 for the subject-matter of claim 1
