5 February 1985, vhich vas published as a German A—document
on 7 August 1986. We have abandoned both this earlier German
appl and the corresponding European application fi led
vithin the priority period, vhich vas also published as a
European A—document at the end of August 1986, and for which
had designated only kT, CH and FR. We abandoned these
appl ications because the search report for the abandoned
European application had brought to light the existence Of a
GB patent disclosing feature a) , but not feature b) .
We believe that the claim 1 of our present patent is too
broad, but are conv that the combination Of features (a)
and (b) is inventive and industrially applicable.
The larger Company, which iS avare Of this situation and is
only prepared to take out a licence under patents for vhich
all knovn relevant prior art has been fully considered by the
European Patent Office, fears that the European patent as
granted may not be legally valid in some designated states.
This is partly in viev of the refractive index mentioned in
the UK patent document and partly also because the earlier —
abandoned — German appl Of 5 February 1985 and the
corresponding European appl ication — likewise abandoned —
contained general information about the temperature range
required for fusing the parts of the double—walled evacuated
glass vessel, and this range included the temperature of
feature b) . The refractive indexes Of the glass employed are
also referred to in the applications Ve have abandoned,
although only in the description and vith different values.
Hovever, ve fear that these values could be considered
equivalent to the value of feature a) .
