(B) Our invention B concerns a seal for screv caps with automatic
pressure compensation, which is particularly important in
thermos flasks fi Iled vith hot drinks. The European Patent
Office granted us a European patent in respect of our
application f iled 20 March 1984. The mention of the grant Of
the patent vas published in March 1989. We have been sent two
notices of opposition filed at the European Patent Office
within the nine—month time limit and have been invited to
comment on them.
1. The statement Of grounds submitted for opposition (I)
f iled by one Of our competitors vas accompanied by a copy
of one of our still unpublished advertising brochures,
which we had provided to a Company Abel. This brochure vas
attached to a dated 19 January 1984 fron Abel to
opponent (I) .
This brochure refers to our invention, although it does
not provide an exact description. Nevertheless, a ski11ed
person would probably not need to exercise his inventive
faculties in order to arrive at the concept as clained in
claim 1 of our European patent. We have for nany years had
business dealings with Abel, VhO evidently nade the
brochure available to opponent (I) despite the long—
standing relationship, involving a tacit understanding of
secrecy , between Our fins. We vere not informed
about this and ve believe that it represents an abuse ot
confidential information.
