2) Opponent (II) based his opposition on prior publications,
alleging that, with respect to the state Of the art, no
inventive step vas involved, although these publications
have Very to do with our invention. They also
assert, as a separate independent argument, that claim 1
of our European patent is not drafted sufficiently clearly
to identify beyond all doubt, vithin the neaning of
Article 84 EPC, the natter for Vhich protection is sought.
Meanwhile, to our surprise, opponent (II) has vithdravn
his opposition. We are not certain vhether this still
affects the opposition proceedings and vhether Ve are
obliged to comment on It.
(c) Another invention c, for Vhich Ve also have a European
patent, concerns an injection noulding technique for the
casings Of vacuum flasks and a casting mould vith a core Of
only two parts. The same two opponents (1) and (II) referred
to above also fi led oppositions to this European patent. The
oppositions were rejected and the EPO Opposition Division
naintained our European patent unanended in a decision dated
20 March 1988. Both opponents appealed and submitted grounds
in due time.
1. In its decision rejecting the oppositions the Opposition
Division stated that the opposition filed by opponent (I)
vas inadmissible. In his notice of opposition
opponent (I) had referred to tvelve new prior publications
and alleged, vithout indicating further details, that any
ski Iled person would be familiar casting moulds
having a two—part core. Citing tvo pages fron a well—known
reference work, no copies of which were enclosed, they
claimed that injection moulding techniques of this kind
knovn to those ski Iled in the art.
