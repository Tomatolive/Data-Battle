In his statenent of reasons to the appeal, opponent (I)
claims in support of his appeal that no inventive step is
involved over the state of the art, as disclosed in the
publications cited during opposition proceedings. They
refer in particular tVO Of the tvelve cited
publications stating that the combination Of the subject—
natter in these tvo documents leads directly to the
subject—natter of claim 1 of Our patent.
When subnitting grounds for his appeal, opponent (II)
introduced into the proceedings for the first time a new
prior publication vhich regrettably precisely anticipates
the characterizing portion of claim 1 of our European
patent. When the document corresponding to the pre—
characterizing portion ot claim 1 is combined vith the new
document, Ve have difficulty in denonstrating an inventive
Although ve believe that the Board of Appeal vill not take
account Of this nev document, as it vas introduced at a
late stage, first in appeal proceedings, ve intend to
submit an alternative claim 1 at the oral proceedings next
veek, vhich incorporates a feature fron an embodiment
disclosed in the description ; this vould make easier
for us to argue inventive step, Since three documents
relating to the prior art vould have to be combined in
order to attack this claim.
Please examine vhether the legal validity Of our applications and
patents is at risk.
