b) Since claim 3 was not searched, amended claims may not relate to this subject-matter,
Rule 137(5) last sentence, EPC
Since there is no communication from the Examining Division yet, the 24-month time limit
has not yet been triggered, Rule 36(1 )(a) EPC Hence, a divisional application for the
subject-matter of claim 3 can be filed For this purpose, EPI must be pending according to
Rule 36(1) EPC (cf. and GI/09)_
Answer to question 3
According to Art. 1 PCT, no intemational filing date has been accorded since the
claims were missing.
In order to avoid re-dating the application which would render the conference novelty
destroying, the applicant should, according to Rule PCT, confirm that the claims
are incorporated by reference according to Rules 4.18 PCT and 20.6(a) PCT. By default,
the current Form PCT/RO/IOI contans a statement of incorporation by reference under
Rule 4.18 PCT.
The time limit for requesting incorporation by reference is two months from the date of the
letter from the EPO, Rule PCT. i.e. 15022011, Rule 80.6 PCT. Today is
1 March 2011, thus the time limit has lapsed.
However, according to Rule 207(b) PCT, the confirmation of incorporation by reference is
to be considered to have been received within the time limit if the notification under Rule
204(i) PCT had not been sent, which applies here. Therefore, it is possible to save the
filing date by immediately confirming the incorporation by reference, Rule and
PCT _
Answer to question 4
a) The limitation fee (Art. 105a(1) EPC) amounts to €1050, Alt. 2(1) No. 10a RFees and a
reduction of 20 % (Rule 6(3) EPC, Art. 14(1) RFees) applies if Spanish is used for the
request for limitation (€1050 - 20% = €840). Further, the publication fee has to be paid
pursuant to Rule 95(3), Art. 2(1) No. 8 RFees_
b) Even though third party observations according to Art 115 EPC are possible in
limitation proceedings, patentability, e.g. novelty, is not examined, Rule 95(2) EPC. The
EPO does not consider such observations. Therefore, third palty observations are
pointless.
The opposition period expires on 02 March 2011, Art. 99(1) EPC Therefore, opposition
should be filed against EP in its entirety based on document X by tomorrow. In addition,
filing an opposition terminates the pending limitation proceedings, Rule 93(2) EPC
Therefore the Imitation fee has to be reimbursed, Rule 93(2), 2nd sentence EPC_
