Examiner's Report Paper D 2011 Part I
Generally, the candidates were able to deal with basic legal issues such as calculating
time limits. As in the recent years questions pointing to the EPC were better answered
than those dealing with the PCT. The candidates referred to the appropnate legal basis,
however not always with the necessary accuracy. This apples in particular to PCT articles
and rules.
Question 1
The majority of candidates realised that the period for filing an opposition has expired and
that "Intervention of the assumed infringer" under Alt. 105 EPC and "Observations by third
parties" under Art. 115 EPC provide two possible options for company A. Some candidates
realised that a warning letter does not mean that infringement proceedings have been
instituted within the meaning of Art. 105(1)(a) EPC.
Question 2
For full marks, all aspects of the questions had to be dealt with, in particular the distinction
between the invitations according to Rule 62a(1) EPC and Rule 70a(1) EPC, as well as the
prosecution of the subject-matter of claim 3.
Question 3
Many candidates correctly stated that incorporation by reference is a remedy for the
missing claims upon filing. However, some of these could have collected full marks if they
had realised that the notification under Rule 204(i) PCT had not yet been issued and that
consequently the incorporation by reference could still be confirmed
Question 4
The question was generally answered well. However, full marks were only given to
candidates who were aware that client C:
•
•
had to attack claims 1 and 2 in order to ensure that claim 1 fell irrespective of the
outcome of the limitation proceedings, and
is of Spanish nationality and therefore qualifies for the fee reduction independently
of his place of residence
Question 5
The majority of candidates dealt well with this question and recognised the crucial point
that filing a European patent application by reference today appeared to be the only
solution to the situation For all marks to be obtained, all the requirements for filing by
reference had to be given, and in particular the requirement for a filing date had to be
recognised _
