Question 6
Again, full marks could only be given to candidates who indicated in detail what steps had
to be taken in the present case for valid entry into the European phase, and that failure to
perform some of these steps led to the application being deemed to be withdrawn.
Further, it had to be stated that the two-month time limit for requesting further processing
according to Art 121(1) and Rule 135(1) EPC is triggered by the notification of loss of
rights under Rule 112(1) EPC, which had not yet been received.
Question 7
Many candidates drew the correct conclusion that the amendment requested by P
contravened Art. 123(2) EPC, which was a new ground for opposition, admissible only with
P's consent. A full analysis distinguished benveen the different sets of claims granted for
the different contracting states.
Question 8
Most candidates were well aware of the possibility to correct the priority of a European
patent application and of the time limits to be observed. It was imponant to recognise that
the relevant 16-month time period runs from the earliest priority date (FR2).
Few candidates realised that EPI could claim priority from FRI if the application was re-
dated according to Rule 56(2) EPC as a result of filing the missing drawing today.
