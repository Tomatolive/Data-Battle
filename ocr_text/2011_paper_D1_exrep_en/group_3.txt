Possible solution - Paper D 2011
Answer to question 1
- Part I
Since the opposition period expired on 28 January 2011 a further opposition cannot be
filed, Art 99(1) EPC_
a) One option for Company A is to intervene in the opposition proceedings. To do so, they
need to institute proceedings for a court ruling that they are not infringing,
Art 105 EPC_
Within 3 months from institution of the proceedings, Company A needs to
• file a notice of intervention in a written reasoned statement based on the novelty
destroying prior an, and
• pay the opposition fee, Rule 89(1), (2) EPC
b) Third party observations could be filed according to Art 115 EPC based on the novelty-
destroying prior an. The observations must be filed in writing and the grounds on which
they are based have to be stated, Rule 114(1) EPC_
For completeness, it is noted that, by intervening, the assumed infringer will be treated as
an opponent, Art 105(2) EPC, whereas by filing third party observations, the assumed
infringer will not become a party to the proceedings.
A less preferred option would be to make the opponent aware of the novelty-destroying
prior art.
Answer to question 2
a) The time limit for replying to the first invitation is 2 months; Rule 62a(1) EPC_
Thus: 09 April 2010 + 10 days (Rule 126(2)EPC) gives 19 April 2010 + 2 months, resulting
in 19 June 2010, which was a Saturday. Therefore the time limit was extended to Monday,
21 June 2010, according to Rule 134(1)EPC, and has expired.
As a means of legal redress, fulther processing is excluded by Rule 135(2)EPC and,
moreover, makes no sense since the search report had already been published, thus
already established before that.
Even though re-establishment of rights according to Art 122 EPC would be possible, it is
not likely to be granted (lack of any hint in the question).
The time limit for replying to the second invitation is 6 months after the mention of the
publication of the European search repot Rule 70a(1) and Rule 70(1 )EPC, i.e.
25 February 201 1, and thus has also already expired (today is 1 March 2011).
However, further processing is possible for the second time limit, Rule 135(2) EPC
Thus:
• the European search opinion should be replied to, and further processing should be
requested by payment of the corresponding fee, Rule Art. 2(1) No. 12 RFees
• the examination fee and the respective further processing fee should be paid.
