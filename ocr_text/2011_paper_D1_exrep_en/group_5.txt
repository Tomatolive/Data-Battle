Answer to question 5
The European patent application has to be filed no later than today. Othenvise the
symposium will constitute prior art according to Art 54(2) EPC since it anticipates subject-
matter Y Since the priority period of ISI has expired, no priority can be claimed,
Art 87(1) EPC The EP application has to be filed by reference because you are not in
possession of a copy of ISI Rule 40(1)(c) EPC To this end, you need to
• indicate that a patent is sought, Rule 40(1)(a) EPC,
• indicate the name or contact information of the applicant, Rule 40(1 )(b) EPC,
• state the office, filing date and number of ISI, Rule 40(2) EPC.
Since the exact filing date is unknown, you cannot fulfil the requirements of Rule 40 EPC
immediately without further action. For instance, you nmght be able to obtain the filing date
e.g. by contacting the Icelandic Patent Office, or you could indicate a probable filing date
and subsequently request correction under Rule 139 EPC if necessary.
Answer to question 6
According to Rule 159(1) EPC the period for entering the European phase expires
31 months after the priority date, i.e 3 July 2008 + 31m = 3 February 2011
By then, the following requirements should have been fulfilled:
•
•
•
•
•
specify the application documents, Rule EPC
file the request for examination (already included in Form 1200), Rule 159(1)(f) EPC
and pay the examination fee
pay the filing fee, Rule 159(1)(c) EPC
pay the designation fee, Rule 159(1)(d) EPC
pay the search fee for the supplementary European search, Rule 159(1)(e) EPC
(which will be reduced since an international search report from the USPTO is
available, OJ 03/2010, p.138)
To fulfil the requirements of Rule 159(1)(b) EPC, the application documents have to be
specified. Further, since none of the requirements of Rule 159(1)(c) - (f) EPC have been
fulfilled, the application is deemed to be withdrawn according to Rule 160(1 ) EPC.
Therefore, further processing according to Art. 121(1) and Rule 135(1) EPC should be
requested with respect to each of these requirements at the latest h,vo months from a
notification under Rule 112(1) EPC which has not yet been received. The applicant has to
perform the omitted acts as required by Rule 135(1 ) EPC within the above time limit.
Within this time limit, the following fees for further processing have to be paid according to
Art 2(1) No. 12 RFees:
• 50% of each of the fees for examination, designation, filing and search, and
• the fee for the late submission of the request for examination (€225)
Additionally, within the 31 -month time period, claims fees should have been paid for claims
exceeding 15, in the present case 2 claims fees, Rule 162(1) EPC_ However, these fees
can still be paid within one month from a communication under Rule 162(2) EPC (as in
force until 30 April 2011).
