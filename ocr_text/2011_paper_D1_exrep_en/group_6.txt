Answer to question 7
P requests the maintenance of the patent based on claim A as granted for DE and FR. As
far as these states are concerned, the claim is not open to an objection under
Art 123(2) EPC, since Alt. 100(c) EPC is not admissible as a ground for opposition
unless the patent proprietor consents, G9/91 , GIO/91 or GI/95, G7/95
The claim of the request with respect to AT and BE represents an amendment and is thus
subject to a full examination as to its compatibility with the requirements of the EPC,
including the provisions of Art 123(2) EPC A change to claim A for AT and BE would
violate Art 123(2) EPC since X was not originally disclosed.
Therefore, the patent cannot be maintained based on claim A for all of DE, FR, AT,
and BE
Answer to question 8
The afficle was published after the filing date of FRI but before the filing date of EPI_ To
prevent the article constituting novelty-destroying prior aft according to Article 54(2) EPC,
the priority of FRI must be claimed.
The priority can be corrected within 16 months from the earliest priority date claimed, or,
where the correction would cause a change in the earliest priority date claimed, within
16 months from the corrected earliest priority date, whichever 16-month period expires
first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of 4 months from the
date of filing accorded to the European patent application, Rule 52(3), EPC The 16-month
periods respectively expire on
• 01 July 2011 for FRI and
• 22 February 2011 for FR2
Thus, the relevant 16-month period expired on 22 February 2011 _ The 4-month time limit
from filing of EPI also expired on 22 February 2011
To be able to correct the declaration of priority it is necessary to file the missing drawing,
so that the 4-month time limit starts running from the new date of filing and can be
observed.
Missing drawings can be filed within h,vo months of the invitation, Rule 56(1 ) EPC, i.e.
4 January 201 1 +10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 2 months = 14 March 2011
When the missing drawing is filed, the application will be re-datedi Rule 56(2) EPC. Since
the twelve-month priority period for FRI expires today, Art. 87(1) EPC, the applicant has to
file the missing drawng today (1 March 2011).
The 4 month time limit for correction of the declaration of priority will then expire on
1 July 2011. By that date, the applicant has to correct the declaration of priority.
Altematively, the applicant may request correction of the priority declaration according to
GL, A-V, 3 or the case law referred to therein.
