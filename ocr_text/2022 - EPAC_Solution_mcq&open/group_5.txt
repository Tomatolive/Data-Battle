Notice from the EPO dated 21 February 2013 concerning the request for early processing, OJ EPO 3/2013,
156 ff
It depends on the date on which early processing is requested which further requirements stipulated in
Rule 159(1) EPC must be complied with, since the (regular) time limits for paying the designation fee
(Rule 39(1) EPC) and the renewal fee (Rule 51(1) EPC) and for filing the request for examination and paying
the examination fee (Rule 70(1) EPC) may not have expired on the date the request for early processing is
filed. Therefore, if any of these time limits is still running on that date, the request will be effective without
the requirements concerned having been complied with (Article 153(2) EPC, Article 11(3) PCT).
Claims fees can be paid up to expiry of the period under Rule 162(2) EPC.
ln the present case, the (regular) time limits for paying the designation, examination and renewal fees are
still running.
Question 13: D
Legal basis
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 8.1, A-IV, 1.1.1
Applicants may withdraw their application at any time as long as the application is pending.
An application is pending up to (but not including) the date that the European Patent Bulletin mentions the
grant of the patent (OJ EPO 2002, 112).
Question 14: B
Legal basis
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 6, C-V, 10
Errors in publication occur where the content of the printed specification differs from the documents
(Druckexemplar) transmitted ta the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) (Form 2004), if
these documents form the basis of the decision to grant. The above errors in publication can be corrected
at any time.
Question 15: B
Statement A is not correct because Rule 56 does not apply to missing claims (the application was filed in
2021, i.e. before the entry into force of the new Rule 56a EPC).
Statement B is correct (Rule 56(3) EPC).
Statement C is not correct because it is not possible to amend the claims before search (Rule 137(1) EPC).
Statement D is not a good solution because the date of a priority claim would precede the date offiling of
the European patent application by more than twelve months.
