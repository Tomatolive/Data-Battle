revoked, since neither the temperature (feature b) nor the
refractive index (feature a) are features vhose novelty has
been prejudiced.
Under case lav relating to Article 54 (3) EPC the temperature
claimed is not anticipated by general indications of
temperature (T 17/85, OJ EPO 1986, 406; T 198/84, OJ EPO 1985,
209) .
The refractive index must also be a nev feature since
equivalents do not belong to the "vhole contents" (T 167/84 ,
OJ EPO 1987, 369).
If the opposition is based on the UX patent, vhich represents
the state of the art under Article 54 (2) EPC, Hittlerer run
little risk that the Opposition Division find the linited
claim obvious in viev of that document.
Re (BI) : The opposition (1) iS admissible because based en
grounds under Article 100 (a) EPC.
The brochure vould have to be taken into account by the
Opposition Division as being a prior publication under
Article 114 (1) EPC (T 156/84, OJ EPO 1988, 372).
The patent proprietor's objection that a nonâ€”prejudicial
disclosure under Article 55(1) (a) EPC is involved does not
hold good. It cannot be Said that the sending of the brochure
by Abel to opponents 1 constituted an evident abuse in
relation to Hittlerer.
