You are a European patent attorney and have today been asked how a client's patent
application may be saved in the following situation:
The European patent application was duly filed on 8 May 1999 without any priority claim,
and the request for examination was duly filed. On 11 July 2001 , the examining division
issued a communication pursuant to Article 96(2) EPC inviting your client to file his
observations within a period of four months. It was not possible for your client to file a
reply as bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against him on 5 December 2000 and he
was barred from proceeding with this application.
In a communication dated 14 October 2001 the applicant's attention was drawn to Article
86(2) and (3) EPC
In a communication dated 18 December 2001 your client was informed that the
European patent application was deemed to have been withdrawn pursuant to Article
96(3) EPC. On 19 March 2002 the bankruptcy proceedings were terminated and your
client was no longer barred from proceeding with the application.
a)
b)
Is there a way to save the application?
What would be your answer if the bankruptcy proceedings did not bar your client
from proceeding with the application?
