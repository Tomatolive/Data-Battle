Question 8
(6 points)
Ms Sumo filed a Japanese patent application in her name on 10 October 2000. On 4
October 2001 she prepared the request for grant of a European patent claiming priority
from the Japanese patent application. In this request Ms Sumo stated that the priority
application was a Japanese patent application and indicated the filing date and filing
number of the earlier application. The European patent application is a complete
translation in English Of the Japanese patent application. In order to send this request to
the EPO in Munich, Ms Sumo delivered it on the same day without a priority document to
a delivery service in Japan. Today Ms Sumo sent you a fax letter together with a copy of
the EPO's confirmation Of receipt, which indicates as date Of receipt 31 October 2001.
Is the priority claim valid?
If so, are there any further steps to be taken in this respect?
Question 9
(3 points)
In the course of opposition proceedings, you submitted on behalf of your client, who is
the patent proprietor, a new set Of claims consisting Of two independent apparatus
claims, based on dependent claims 2 and 3 as granted. The sole opponent withdrew his
opposition after validly filing his statement Of grounds and submitting a document which
was prejudicial to the novelty of claim 1 as granted.
You received the opposition division's decision on 18 March 2002.
The decision revoked the patent for lack Of unity Of invention. It seems clear from the
decision that the subject-matter of the two claims is considered new, inventive and in
accordance with the provisions Of Art. 123 EPC, but not unitary.
Your client would like to appeal but is afraid that the cost would be too high. Do you think
that he has a chance Of success?
