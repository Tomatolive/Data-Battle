Part II
II. Brightco would like to obtain patent protection covering the •invention' Of EP2, namely
devices which incorporate the improved fibre Of Such protection is required in Europe,
Australia, Japan and US. •Ihey would also like to protect the improvements made by Newman,
the improvements being required due to an unexpected problem in the devices of EP2
There are two maln alternatives for obtaining patent protection in Europe (EP), Australia
(AU), Japan (JP) and US. The first is to file separate applications in each State. This will
involve a high initial Outlay on filing. The Other alternative is to file a single
designating EP (one designation), US, AU and JP. This is Initially much cheaper, and defers
the main costs for at least a year as required.
The PCT application may be filed at a receiving Office which is "competent", Article 10 PCT.
By Rule 19 PCT, this can be any office in, or acting for, a state for which at least one of the
applicants is a national or resident, or at the International Bureau of WIPO. As will be
discussed below, there are various possible applicants, however these all appear to be
nationals and residents of Britain, Therefore, the application must be filed at either the British
Patent Office, the European Patent Office, or at the International Bureau.
The application must cover the described examples X and Y of EP2. As there were disclosed
on 24 June 1994, priority must be validly claimed from an earlier application before this date,
otherwise the application will not meet the requirements for novelty.
Priority may only be claimed from the first relevant earlier application - Article 8 PCT and
Article 4 of the Paris Convention. This earlier application is one in or for a Convention State,
and must be filed no more than 12 months earlier.
Accordingly. if priority is Only Claimed from EP2, no priority will be clamed from Üiy matter
contained in EPI, even if this is also contained in EP2. This is because EPI will be the first
earlier application for such matter
Since EPI disclosed the broadest general concept of the use of the improved optical fibre in
devices, to obtam broad protection for this, priority must be claimed from EPI, as well as
If there is no valid priority claim for the broad invention, the disclosure of 24 June 1994 will
be relevant State Of the art. In this case, such a broad claim would lack novelty (for example
under Articles 32(1) and 54 EPC).
Therefore, priority must be claimed from EP-L•nd-EP-2.
TO Claim priority, as indicated above, the later application must be filed within 12 months Of
the first relevant earlier application. The relevant application was filed on 14 April 1994, and
so the new application should be filed by 14 April 1995. However, Rule 80.5 PCT provides
that where a period exptres on a day on which the national office where the document may
be filed is closed, the period will be extended to the next working day. By president's notice
Of 10.11.94, the 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th April 1995 are all days On which the EPO is closed.
