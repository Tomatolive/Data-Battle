As searches have been carried Out by the EPO, the request for grant made on filing the PCT
application should indicated these searches. This is allowed - Rule 4. In this way,
the EPO as Intemational Searching Authority will allow a reduction in the International
Search Fee due - Legal Advice 14/83, agreement between EPO and WIPO
As pointed out, the application may be filed by fax - the EPO allow this - agreement with
The application must be in a language allowed by the Receiving Office which depends on the
language allowed by the International Search Authority. If the Receiving Office is the
Intemational Bureau or EPO, the language may be English, French or German. If it is the
British Patent Office (which I also assume to be closed 14-17 April) then it must be in
English.
My advice is to file a PCT application
designating EP, US, AU and JP, claiming
• priority from EPI and EP2 by 18 April 1995.
In this Case. the application may be filed at UKPO. EPO or WIPO.
The priority claim must be made on filing - Article 8(1) PCT and Rule 4.10 PCT which
requires the dates and states of the earlier applications. Certified copies must be filed by 14
August.
ne transmittal fee, basic fee and search fee should all be paid within one month of filing -
Rules 14. 15.40) and 16. I(b) PCT respectively
This is by 18 May 1995. A request should be made under Rule 16.3 PCT for a partial refund
of the search fee.
A designation fee should be paid under Rule 15. I(ii) PCT within 12 months of priority
(18 April) or 1 month Of filing (18 May 1995) - Rule 15.4(b)(ii) PCT, (i.e. by 18 May),
Eventually, it will be possible to convert the international application into national or regional
applications (entering the national phase) in EP, AU, JP and US. This may be done under
Article 22(1) PCT after 20 months from priority date, i.e. by 16 December 1995.
Alternatively, and in view Of the desire to defer Costs, a "Chapter II demand" may be filed
under Article 31 (l) PCT. Providing this demand is filed within 19 months Of the pnority date,
i.e. by 16 November 1995, the date for entering the national phße is extended under
Article PCT to 30 months from the priority date, i.e. until 16 October 1996.
In the EPO, these periods are extended by a further month - Rule 104b(l) EPC
The application should name Brightco as applicant for all states except US, Lamda and
Kappa as inventors for all states, and as applicant for US.
