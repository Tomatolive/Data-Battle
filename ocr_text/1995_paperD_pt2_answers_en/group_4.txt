Assignments to Brightco will be needed, probably in the form of assignments from Glaz√¶co
who will own the rights initially by employment of Larnda and Kappa. For US. assignments
will be needed from Lamda and Kappa
Newman's invention may be filed as a separate application, or if time permits may be included
in the PCT case.
An assignment of the right to claim priority will also be needed as EPI and EP2 are in the
name of Glazeco, and priority may only be claimed from an earlier application by the
applicant or his predecessor in title - Article 4, Paris Convention
II. Potent!AUoftingemgnt
In US, a patent is not published until it is granted. Therefore Flashco have a granted US
patent for their method Of making the improved fibres.
The US patent. USPI, would appear to cover a method for manufacturing improved optical
fibres. This will probably protect both the method, and fibres made by the method. Brightco
do not intend to manufacture any fibres - they intend to buy from Glazeco. Glazeco make
fibres by a different method. Therefore, neither Glazeco or Brightco can infringe the existing
US patent.
At present, there can be no infringement of PCT(F) as this has not been granted. Nevertheless.
there is the potential of infringement if the patent is granted.
PCT(F) presently covers a method for producing the fibres. and a device using a fibre. AS
discussed above. Brightco are not manufacturing fibres and so they could not infringe the
method. Similarly, GlazeCO are using a different method and so do not infringe. Nevertheless,
Brightco intend to make device X which would infringe a claim to this if granted resulting
from PCT(F).
However, EP2 discloses device X. As Brightco intend to file a PCT application claiming
priority from EP2 and including details of X, this should enable them to prevent a European
patent being granted to Flashco covering device X.
Article 54(3) EPC provides that the state of the art for novelty includes European or PCT
applications with a date of filing earlier than the present application but not published until
after the date of filing of the present application. By Art. 89 EPC, date of filing is priority
date. This applies to earlier European applications and PCT applications designating Europe
providing these are in English, French or German, and the national fee is paid to enter the
national phase in Europe - Article 158(1) and (2) EPC
The details Of device X were not included in USPI, and therefore the priority date for this
invention for Flashco is the date of filing Of PCT(F), namely 19 May 1994.
By filing a PCT application covenng device X, and claiming pnonty from EP2, providing this
application eventually enters the national phase in Europe, this will form part Of the state of
