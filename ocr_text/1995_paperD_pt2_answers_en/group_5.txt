the art against PCT(F) in Europe. Accordingly, PCT(F) in Europe will lack novelty as regards
device X, and therefore no patent will be granted to Flashco covering this
In summary. by filing a PCT application and eventually entering the European phase, Brightco
can prevent Flashco from obtaining a European patent covering deuce X. Therefore. Brightco
do not need a licence in respect of Europe.
Regarding the US, the situation is less clear as the US have a first to invent system, not a first
to file. Accordingly. Flashco may show that they invented device X, and reduced this to
practice in the US first, and so are entitled to the patent in the US. Therefore, a licalce may
be required for US.
Another potential ground of attack on PCT(F) will be prior disclosure at the Trade Fair of
9-12 May 1994. This was before the earliest priority date for device X. the earliest date being
the date of filing. In respect of most countries, the state of the art comprises anything made
available to the public. Accordingly, the disclosure at the trade fair will generally form part
of the state of the art as it was shown and described. This is not withstanding the fact that the
dran data sheet was not circulated.
However, Japan and US both have grace periods Of 6 months and 12 months respectively.
This allows an application to be filed, and any disclosure by the applicant within the grace
period before the filing will be deemed not to form part Of the state Of the art. Therefore, in
Japan and US, the prior disclosure will have no effect on the patentability. Therefore, a
licence may still be required for Japan and US.
Regarding attacking PCT(F), this cannot be done yet. The provisions outlined above under
Article 54(3) EPC in Europe only apply when PCT(F) enters the national phase in Europe,
and after Brightco's PCT applications enter the national phase in Europe. Accordingly, there
is no relevant prior art from EP2 currently in existence with which Brightco can attack the
PCT(F) application.
Although the prior disclosure at the trade fair will be useful as an attack in future, it cannot
be used yet as it is not relevant for all states, and as the PCT has no provision for third party
Observations. This may be used nationally later.
PCT applications are published about 1 8 months after the priority date - Article 21 PCT
Therefore, PCT(F) should be published about now (21 March).
The demand for international examination need not be made yet, although in practice to get
the full effect from such examination, this should be made within 19 months of priority, i.e.
by 21 April 1995 - Article PCT. It is possible to confirm whether the demand is
It is possible to obtain a copy of the examination report - Article 380) PCT provides that
the report is confidential.
