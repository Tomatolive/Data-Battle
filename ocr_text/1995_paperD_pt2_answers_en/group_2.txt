Therefore, the PCT application may be filed on and validly Claim priority
from EPI and EP2. (I assume that the UK P.O. is also closed on these dates due to Easter,
and so the application may be validly filed at the UKPO or EPO on 18.0495).
Even though only the filing and search fees were paid for EPI and EP2, under Article 80

With regard to the improvements made by Newman, if the details of these are available in
time, they may be included in the application. This would certainly save money as the costs
of further applications would not be necessary.
If Newman's invention is not available by 18 April, this can be filed separately at a later date.
Since Newman's invention is the recognition ofa problem (which is itself patentable generally,
for example in the EPO Guidelines C-IV, 9), and it is indicated that this would not be obvious
even in view Of X and Y, there would be no problem from a patent view point in filing this
later
In view Of the comments, it appears the invention won't be ready to file by next Tuesday, and
so it is likely to require filing separately. This may initially be a European patent application.

applicant for US if his invention is included in the application.
It is necessary for the applicants to give an authorization for the representative. This must be
done by each applicant signing the request or a separate power Of attorney - Rule 90.40)
PCT. Accordingly, powers Of attorney authorising a representative will be required from
Kappa, Lamda, Brightco and, if named, Newman. Such an authorization may be filed on
request from the receiving office. Accordingly, when Kappa and Lamda return, they must Sign
an authorization,
A power Of attorney cannot be filed by fax, and therefore the filing of the power of attomey
from Brightco must be filed by hand or by post, but may be filed after the application - PCT
Guidelines (EPO as Receiving Office).
When making a priority claim, Rule 17. I (a) PCT requires the filing Of a copy of the earlier
application certified by the authority with which it was filed. This must be submitted to the
International Bureau or the receiving office within 16 months of the priority date.
Accordingly, certified copies Of EPI and EP2 must be filed by 14 August 1995 (calculated
under Rule 80.2 PCT)_ The photocopy of EP2 will not meet the requirements unless certified
by the EPO A certified copy Of a priority document cannot be filed by fax.
