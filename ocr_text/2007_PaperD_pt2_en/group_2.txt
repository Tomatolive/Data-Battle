You are a professional representative and today, 6 March 2007, you receive the
following letter from a new client, Caledonian Sportswear Ltd.
We are a UK based company manufacturing textiles and sportswear and control a small
group of financially connected but legally independent companies that includes
company Sean Insulation Ltd, a manufacturer of insulating panels for the automotive
and aircraft industries. Please advise us on the following pending matters to be dealt
with in the near future.
1. Two years ago, while searching for new fibres for warm sportswear we developed a
new polymer composition (composition B + A). This composition is a mix of known
polymers B and A and with it we produced thick and rigid foamed sheets having very
good insulation properties. Since these foamed sheets were relevant to the technology
of our subsidiary Sean Insulation Ltd. we transferred the technology and all relevant
rights to them. On 16 September 2005 they filed a UK application (UK-I ) disclosing and
claiming composition B + A and insulating rigid foamed sheets made of composition
Early last year we developed a new way of processing polymer composition B + A With
this process, thin and flexible foamed sheets can be obtained from composition B + A
Such thin sheets are suitable for scuba-diving suits and for swimming and surf
costumes and are superior to known thick materials.
