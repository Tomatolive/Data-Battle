The new compositions of polymer B + polymers of class Z , the fibres, the textiles and
the thin foamed sheets of polymer B alone and of polymer B + polymers of class Z will
be produced in a new factory that we are building in Australia. A world-wide protection
for all the features disclosed in our applications is essential for our company to protect
the huge investments we made in research. We intend to sell Sean Insulation Ltd and
all its assets, to finance the construction of the Australian factory. Sean Insulation's
patent poltfolio comprises only application I-JK-I and an international application
Sean PCT, which was filed by them on 2 September 2006, claims priority of UK-I and
has the same description and claims as UK-I
2 Our former employee Ms Moneypenny was involved in the study of how to process
the new polymer composition polymer B + polymers of class Z into textiles. During this
work Ms Moneypenny devised the extrusion process that is claimed in EP-3_ She also
devised a new weaving process (process ALFA) specially designed for and requiring
the yarns of polymeric composition B + A. Process ALFA reduces the time required for
obtaining a square meter of woven fabric by 25%. Because at that time we were not
interested in this weaving process we did not file an application. Ms Moneypenny
resigned from our company in May 2006 to start her own business.
To our astonishment, we have recently received a warning letter from our competitors
Goldfinger Ltd, an Irish Company, informing us of their European patent application
EP-Gold. A copy of the EP-Gold filing documents was enclosed with the letter. EP-Gold
was filed as a first application on 13 July 2006 and it claims weaving process ALFA.
Application EP-Gold also claims the woven fabric.
No mention is made of the extrusion process or of the yarns required for the weaving
process.
