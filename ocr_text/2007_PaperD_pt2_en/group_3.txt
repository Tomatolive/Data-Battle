On 18 March 2006 we filed an EP application (EP-I) as first filing. EP-I discloses and
claims the polymer composition B + A, the new foaming process of manufacturing the
thin sheets and the thin sheets thus obtained. The description also discloses examples
of scuba diving suits and swimming and surf costumes made of foamed composition
B + A, as well as one example of a suit made of a new sheet of foamed polymer B
alone. In addition, one comparative example of a known suit made of foamed polymer A
IS given.
We usually pay the filing and search fees on the very last day but in the case of EP-I
we forgot to pay in time and in May 2006 we received a communication from the EPO
pointing out that the fees could still be paid with a surcharge.
Rather than paying the surcharge, we did not respond and on 19 June 2006 we filed
another EP Application (EP-2) claiming priority of IJK-I_ All the fees for EP-2 were paid.
EP-2 has identical claims to EP-I, the description of EP-2 corresponds to the
description of EP-I with the exception that we removed the example and all references
to polymer B alone and we added examples of thin foamed sheets obtained from
compositions of polymer B with other known foamable polymers C, D and E. Polymers
C,D and E are known to be similar to polymer A and are part of a class of polymers
(class Z) which comprises, among others, polymers A, C, D and E
In the meantime we have found that foamed sheets made only of polymer B could be
thin enough to become commercially very interesting.
