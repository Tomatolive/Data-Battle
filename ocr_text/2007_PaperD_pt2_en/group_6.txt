In their letter, Goldfinger Ltd warn us against using weaving process ALFA and against
selling any woven fabric obtained from composition B + A unless we pay them huge
royalties.
We immediately contacted Ms Moneypenny who informed us, Caledonian Sportswear
Ltd, of the following facts:
She orally disclosed, under a written secrecy agreement, process ALFA to
Goldfinger Ltd in June 2006. She told them that it is her invention and, by contract
between her and us, we are the rightful owner of this invention. She further told
Goldfinger Ltd that, in her view, we were not interested in weaving process ALFA
She did not disclose to Goldfinger the process of making fibres
On 20 December 2006 she filed a national application (UK-Penny). This
application refers to the press release, discloses process ALFA and discloses and
claims an improvement of process ALFA, called weaving process BETA This
improvement consists of an additional feature Y by which all kinds of yarns, i.e.
also yarns obtained from B + any of the polymers of class Z, can be treated at the
same high speed by the weaving process BETA Claim 1 of UK-Penny
corresponds to claim 1 of EP-Gold plus the additional feature Y _
Ms Moneypenny proposed closely cooperating with Caledonian to develop, protect and
exploit new universal weaving process BETA
We are very interested in the new process of Ms Moneypenny and are willing to resume
cooperation with her.
On the basis of Ms Moneypenny's information we replied to the warning letter of
Goldfinger telling them that we are the owners of any right to process ALFA. Goldfinger
answered that they had devised and developed process ALFA independently, on the
basis of the information given in the above-mentioned article in AJSS_
