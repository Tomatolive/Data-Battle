We have received the search report for EP-2 from the EPO The search report cited just
one prior document:
- US-Spectre published in May 2005 discloses polymer A and its use for making
foamed sheets for scuba diving; these sheets are as thick as the traditional, known
sheets.
We recently found that the June 2006 issue of "American Journal of Surf and Scuba"
(AJSS) contains a scientific article that discusses patent US-Spectre_ The article
suggests using polymer B alone or in combination with A or other similar polymers such
as polymers C and D, to reduce the thickness of foamed sheets for scuba-diving suits
and surf costumes. The date printed on this publication is 16 June 2006
We also developed a new extrusion process for transforming the polymer compositions
of polymer B + polymers of class Z (such as A or C, D, E) into fibres and yarns with
which textiles are produced. Before our new process, only foams could be obtained
from the compositions B + polymers of class Z
The textiles have the same thermal insulation properties as the foamed sheets obtained
from the same polymer compositions B + polymers of class Z Woven textiles are very
good for scuba-diving suits and for surf costumes, while non-woven are very good as
insulating liners for rigid insulating panels.
On 7 July 2006 we filed patent application EP-3 (no priority was claimed), that discloses
and claims the extrusion process, the polymer compositions B + polymers of class Z
and textiles obtainable therefrom, i.e. woven and non-woven textiles.
Composition B + A, the extrusion process for producing yarns and fibres made of it and
the textiles were disclosed at a press release in August 2006.
