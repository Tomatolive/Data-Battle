Mr. A produced toys made of a plastic material P. His competitor B was granted a
European patent with two claims, claim 1 for the composition of P and claim 2 for a
method of producing P.
Mr. A filed a valid opposition against B's patent This opposition is pending. Because ML
A has always bought P, and was not interested in methods for producing P, the extent of
the opposition was limited to claim 1
There is no further opposition and the time limit for filing an opposition has expired.
Mr. A died during the opposition proceedings.
Can his sole heir ML H become a party to the opposition proceedings?
If so, can the opposition be extended to cover the method of producing P?
