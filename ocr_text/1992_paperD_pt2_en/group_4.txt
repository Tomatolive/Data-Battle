As a resuit Of the unexpected defection of this enployee to our
competitor ve have. carried out a detailed audit Of the patent
coverage on our present and future products; ve are extremely
concerned on a nunber of natterS and vould appreciate your advice
and, vhere appropriate, innediate action to avoid loss of rights.
Firstly, it appears that since our last audit on 16 Harch 1992, one
Of the only tvo sanples Of our latest version of nicrochip has
disappeared; I believe it has been passed to Titanic Computers SA
by Mr Tester. The nicrochip vas being kept very secret vithin our
conpany because Ve believe it be Ot value.
The special feature of the nicrochip is the particular arrangement
of the attachnent pins. This Feature was designed sone tine ago
and was felt, until recently, to be of no commercial value; in fact
all details of Feature A were disclosed together vith another
invention in the patent application GB—K tiled at the UX Patent
Office in our nane on 3 June last year (1991) . On 2 Septenber last
year ( 1991) Ve fi led a European patent application EP—L claining
priority fron an earlier UX patent application GB—H fi led on
5 September 1990 and fron ux patent application GB—K; copies of
both the priority documents were fi led with the European patent
application EP—L. We did not realise the significance of Feature A
at the time of filing the European patent application EP—L and all
reference to the pins (and thus Of feature A) onitted the
European patent application EP—L. The European patent application
EP—L vas published three geeks ago.
It is likely that Titanic Computers, in league with Tester, will
soon file a European patent application on Feature A as if it were
their ovn invention.
