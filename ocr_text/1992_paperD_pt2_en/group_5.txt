The second thing we discovered during our audit Vas that, despite
the system our Company has implenented ensure that all patent
natters are treated with due care, a number of errors have occured
in the handl ing of our European patent applications.
Our Company has a policy of fil ing all its European patent applic—
ations designating UR, France, Germany and Switzerland; these are
the only European countries in vhich our conpetitors manufacture.
In the published European patent application EP—L mentioned above,
found that Switzerland has not been designated but that Sweden
has' upon checking the application documents, ve found that they
had been incorrectly completed. In another of our European patent
applications EP—N fi led recently, the box for Sweden has also been
crossed on the application fon, whereas the box for Switzerland
has not; EP—N is a divisional application fi led because of lack of
unity of invention of one of our earlier published applications.
It appears from our files that,the clerk who fi Iled out the fons
for the two cases mistakenly interpreted our abbreviation for
Switzerland "sw" to be the code for Sweden. This error is very
serious, since it renders us unable to Prevent Titanic Computers SA
fron using Our invention ; every effort must be made to ensure
Switzerland is designated correctly.
