Since we rely on good patent protection in order to succeed in this
highly competitive field, we request your advice on the nost
appropriate neasures available to us so that we can recover the
protection we need. The cost of such neasures is not a prime
consideration. I believe that our company can scarcely survive
unless can prevent Titanic Computers SA and our other
conpetitors fron using our inventions.
We are avare Of the risks if Ve infringe existing rights, and
request your opinion on the above nentioned patent applications Of
our conpetitors. I look forward to receiving your advice on the
measures Should take to protect our rights, and to avoid
infringing the rights Of others.
Yours faithfully
HAROLD ABACUS
