Our new portable computer, which Will be launched in the next few
weeks, includes all the features covered in our patent applications
mentioned above. In addition, have just tound out that our new
portable computer includes inventions vhich have been disclosed and
are, or nay yet be, claimed in two patent applications ti led by our
competitors.
Cl :
The first invention is covered by a European patent application
designating all contracting states in the name of Titanic Computers
SA; the patent application vas fi led geveral years ago, and atter
several communications from the substantive examiner, in a reasoned
decision from the Examining Division dated 4 Novenber 1991 the
application vas finally rejected because of Iack of inventive step.
On 5 December 1991, Titanic Computers SA filed a notice Of appeal
and paid at the sane tine the appeal tee. In a letter received at
the EPO on 16 March 1992 Titanic Computers stated that the decision
Of the Exanining Division vas incorrect and that a detailed
statenent of grounds of appeal vould fol Iov. We understand that
this statenent only received last Week, on 1 April 1992. It
seems that, in the acconpanying letter, Titanic Computers requests
that the statenent be accepted despite the late ti ling and that the
delay be excused. Do you think there is a possibility that the
Board of Appeal could excuse the delay in fi ling the grounds of the
appeal? We believe that this patent should in tact have been
granted by the Examining Division to Titanics Computers. Can Ve
nevertheless assume that no patent resuit, which could present
an obstacle to us? We have already made preparations to use the
invention. Tester knovs Of these preparations and will certainly
alert Titanic Computers to this.
