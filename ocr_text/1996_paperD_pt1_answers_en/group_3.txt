said to be when we received the letters from the Applicant, because the Applicant did not realise
what was going on. Although case law shows that the EPO can be quite generous to
unrepresented applicants, the case is weak.

A45(2) PCT - the law Of any State may proude that a designation is assumed to be for a regional
patent.
Since Jan 1995 the Netherlands has provided that a designation will have the effect of the
designation Of a European Patent,
Therefore this designation will be taken as designation of a European Patent
The US designation is only valid if the applicant is the inventor Art 27(3) PCT
The Other designations should be valid.
According to Article SS(2) EPC, display at any exhibition should be stated on filing. and a
certificate filed within 4 months (Rule 23 EPC).
Neither of these have been done, and we want additional states, so file either a new EP
Application and a US Application, or a PCT designating EP (all states) and the U.S.
It is not clear from Art. 55 EPC whether the six month period runs before the filing or priority
date.
To be safe, assume filing date and file the new applications before 01 April 1996 (Monday).
Priority should be claimed from the original EP application, particularly if any disclosures have
occurred after filing.
