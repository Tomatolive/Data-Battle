a) A 9 PCT - the applicant for a PCT application must be a resident or national Of a contracting
Rule 18 PCT defines residence and nationality.
South Africa is not a contracting state of the PCT
therefore the application cannot proceed in the South African's name only.
b) Australia is a contracting State therefore according to Art 9 PCT the Australian is entitled to
be a PCT Applicant.
The Application would have to be filed at the prescribed receiving office (Art 10 PCT)
According to Rule 19 PCT. this would be the Australian Patent Offce (R PCT.
R 19. PCT or the Intemational Bureau (R 19.
Therefore you could file at the international Bureau
