If the document was published in 1986 and clearly anticipated the subject matter of the patent
(all claims) the patent is invalid for all states (Art 520) EPC and Article 54(1)&(2) or Art. 56
EPC)
To get the royalties back, the patent must be invalidated or not brought into force. It is not made
clear whether the patent was brought into force in all the designated states by complying with
the National Requirements according to Art EPC Deadline expired 1995 October 05
(Tuesday).
This should be checked by inspecting national registers
If the patent was brought into force in at least some of the countries. it should not simply be
allowed to lapse by non payment of renewals, as then it will not have been "invalidated" and
back royalties will not be repaid.
Therefore, if it is financially worthwhile an opposition could be filed so as to obtain invalidation
of all the national patents in one procedure. An opposition may be filed even if the patent has
lapsed for all the designated States (Art 99(3) EPC).
The deadline for filing opposition expires on 5th April 1996 Friday, extended under A 85(1) to
9th April 1996 (5th April is Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 8th April = Easter Monday)
Therefore contact company A saying that unless they repay the royalties, company B will oppose
the patent.
Depending on their reply, the patent could be opposed, revoked, and the royalties recovered (or
A sued for breach of contract).
Art 86(1) EPC Renewal Fees are due for the third year calculated from the filing date. Rule 37(1)
EPC - the fees are due on the last day of the month.
3rd years renewal fee is due 31 March 1995 Friday
