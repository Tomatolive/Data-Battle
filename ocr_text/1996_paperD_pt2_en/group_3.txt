PART Jl
You are the Industrial Property director of the German company BAVARIA in Munich,
which has recently decided to enter the field of domestic illumination by considering the
acquisition of some small companies, CASINO, ZORBAS, FLEUR, 1 FFK
You have now - Wednesday 27 March 1996 - on your table the following reports prepared by
the companies about their IP rights and all supporting documents. They have been prepared and
submitted under confidentiality agreements
CASINO
Ours is a Swiss company based in Lugano.
We invented a new lamp, characterised by a particular technically advantageous
arrangement J Of the metal elements Of the lamp. We found that the best performance was
obtained when the elements were made Of gold. We prepared an EP patent application EPCI
(designating all contracting states) including a full description of this lamp Cl, an independent
claim directed to a lamp incorporating arrangement J and a claim dependent thereon claiming the
elements made of gold; indeed, we noted that a lamp incorporating J per se appeared to be new
and inventive, and had great commercial possibilities.
We sent the application EPCI to the EPO in Munich by an overnight courier arriving on Friday
I December 1995. EPCI was filed in Italian. Shortly after that, before any fees had been paid
for EPCI , we discovered that - unexpectedly - even better performance could be achieved if the
elements were made of iron instead Of gold. This lamp with iron elements will be referred to as
C2. so, a new EP application EPC2. also in Italian, was prepared by us modifying the description
and claims of EPCI by replacement of all references to gold by references to iron. EPC2
(designating all contracting states) was sent to the EPO in Munich by an overnight courier
arriving on Friday 5 January 1996, together with a check Of DEM 2500 covering filing and
search fees. Only at the beginning Of February we realised that the envelope we sent containing
EPC2 did not contain the pages with the claims. Thus, we resubmitted the application, EPC4, by
an overnight courier arriving on Monday 5 February 1996, ensuring this time that all the papers
were present.
We have also an EP application EPC3 on a very important manufactunng process C3 for lamps
Application EPC3 was filed on Monday 3 February 1992. A communication from the EPO dated
Friday 10 November 1995 indicated that the invention was new and inventive, but that some
amendments were needed to comply with the EPCâ€¢, an apparently extendable time limit of four
months was set for replying. Due to financial difficulties we have taken no further action in
respect Of any Of the applications EPCI, EPC2, EPC3 and EPC4
We have not manufactured any lamps incorporating the above inventions yet, and the only non-
confidential disclosure we made was at a local exhibition on Wednesday 6 December 1995. On
that occasion, wre showed a prototype Of C I (including the elements made Of gold) and explained
orally our invention Cl to a couple of potential clients, without giving them any written material.
