We invented a new lamp Fl, for which we filed a French patent application FREI on Wednesday
15 March 1995. We then carried out a private patent search; the results of the search suggested
that the invention would be patentable.

applications in other countries. However, the invention h√ü never been disclosed and FRFI has
not been published yet
