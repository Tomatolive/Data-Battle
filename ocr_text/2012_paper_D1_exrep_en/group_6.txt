48 2(a) ii-iv) PCT), a standardized front page (Rule 48.2 (a) i PCT) including the abstract
(Rule 48.2(b) iii) PCT) and title, and the search report
Since the amendments and statement under Article 19 PCT were filed with the 1B within
the time limit of Rule 46.1 PCT, these will also be published, Rule 48.20, Rule 482(a)(vi)
PCT.

(Rule 46.3 PCT) and the statement under Article 19 PCT (Rule 464 PCT) will be
published in Chinese. The abstract, title and search report will be published in English and

Answer to question 6
For Invl, EPI validly claims priority from ITI , because EPI was filed within the priority
period and in respect of the same invention, Article 87(1) EPC Therefore, document D is
not part of the state of the art and protection can be obtained for Invl
EPI does not claim the priority of IT 2 for Inv2 Thus, the effective date for Inv2 in EPI is
28 October 2011 _ This is after D was published Therefore, at present D is comprised in
the state of the art in accordance with Article 54(2) EPC, and destroys the novelty of Inv2
in EPI _ Hence, only with a valid claim to priority of IT 2 protection for Inv2 in EPI can be
obtained.
The insertion of a priority declaration under Rule 52(2) EPC is no longer possible because
the 16-month time limit expired on 28 February 2012. Further processing is ruled out, Rule
135(2) EPC
Filing a request for correction of the priority declaration under Rule 139 EPC, first sentence,
is possible Since EPI has not been published yet and the preparations for publication
have not been terminated yet, such a request has the potential to be granted (J3/91, J6/91
or J9/91)_
Answer to question 7
According to GI/07 a method including a surgical step is excluded from patentability under
Article 53(c) EPC. Thus, any method comprising (a) is excluded from patentability.
Diagnostic methods carried out outside the human body, such as (b), are not excluded
under Article 53(c) EPC, GI /04. Since the known method of biopsy (a) is not an essential
feature of the method of diagnosing the illness, it can be omitted from a possible claim
(Article 84 EPC). Thus (b) taken alone is patentable
