Examiners' Report Paper D 2012 - Part I
As a positive trend it was noticed that more candidates cited the relevant legal basis with
the necessary accuracy, which in the past has been a problem, especially for PCT-
questions.
Candidates are reminded to accept the facts given in the paper and to limit themselves to
these facts. See, for example, comments to question 6, last paragraph.
Question 1
The majority of candidates recognized that the relevant date for calculating the period of
appeal was 27 December 2011. However, not all of these candidates cited a T-decision
relevant for the fact that a correction of the decision according to Rule 140 EPC has a
retrospective effect
Some candidates did not realize that the concept of extension of periods according to Rule
134(1) EPC is not applicable to the date on which the decision was deemed delivered in
accordance with Rule 126(2) EPC
Other candidates thought that the reference to Article 56 EPC rather than Alticle 54 EPC
implied a procedural violation and did not comment at all on the correction under Rule 140
EPC
Few candidates recognized that reimbursement of the appeal fee is possible if the appeal
is withdrawn in due time.
Question 2
Some candidates did not realize when amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force and
therefore did not differentiate between the requirements for DIVI and DIV2. Few
candidates were aware of the relevant transitional provisions, which apply to DIV2_
Although only the filing requirements were asked for under item a), some candidates lost
time by listing other requirements, like payment of various fees.
A large number of candidates did not understand that the notification of the pallial search
report does not start the time limit for mandatory division according to Rule 36(1)(b) EPC
Question 3
Most candidates correctly referred to the supplementary international search and the
corresponding provisions of the PCT.
However, some candidates suggested entering into the regional phase before the EPO to
have the second invention searched in the supplementary European search. Since the
question states that your client wants a search to be carried out by the EPO before
deciding on entry into the national/regional phase, such answers were not awarded any
marks.
