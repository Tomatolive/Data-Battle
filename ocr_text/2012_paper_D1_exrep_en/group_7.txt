Answer to question 8
Since the subject-matter of the amended claims is new and inventive over the originally
disclosed subject-matter, it extends beyond the content of the application as filed, contrary
to Article 123(2) EPC Therefore, the amended clams are not allowable. Thus, no
protection for the improved subject-matter can be obtained via EPI
EPI has been published. Therefore, the files relating to EPI may be inspected according
to Article 128(4) EPC Since the amendments filed by the applicant in June 2011 are not
excluded from file inspection by Rule 144 EPC, these were made available to the public as
of June 2011, i.e. before the date of filing of EP2 These amendments are therefore
comprised in the state of the art according to Art. 54(2) EPC and are novelty destroying for
the improved subject-matter claimed in EP2. Thus, no protection for the improved subject-
matter can be obtained via EP2_
