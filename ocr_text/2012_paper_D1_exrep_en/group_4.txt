The decision refusing the application was deemed delivered on 6 January 2012
(27 December 2011 + 10 days, Rule 126(2) EPC). This is the starting date for calculating
the time limit to appeal. In accordance with Article 108 EPC, notice of appeal shall be filed
within 2 months of notification of the decision Therefore, the period for filing the notice of
appeal and paying the appeal fee expires today, 6 March 2012. It is advisable to file the

Answer to question 2
a) Amended Rule 36(1) EPC entered into force on 1 April 2010.
DIVI was filed on 14 December 2009, i.e. before amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force
Hence, previous Rule 36(1) EPC applies, requiring only that the earlier application is
pending. Moreover, according to Alticle 76(1) and Rule 36(2) EPC (as in force until 31
March 2010), the divisional has to be filed in the language of the proceedings for EPI with
the EPO in Munch, The Hague or Berlin Since DIVI was filed in English with the EPO in
Munich, and EPI was still pending on 14 December 2009, all requirements were met.
DIV2 was filed on 30 September 2010, i.e. after amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force

application before the expiry of 24 months from the examining division's first
communication in respect of the earliest application (i.e. EPI)_ This time limit expired
before 1 April 2010. According to the transitional provision applicable to amended Rule
36(1) EPC (Article 3 of the Decision of the Administrative Council of 25 March 2009, OJ
2009, 298 or 485) a divisional application of EPI could still be filed until 1 October 2010.
Moreover, according to Alticle 76(1) and amended Rule 36(2) EPC, the divisional has to
be filed in the language of the proceedings for EPI at the EPO in Munich, The Hague or
