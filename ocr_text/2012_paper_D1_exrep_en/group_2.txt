Not all candidates stated to which office the request should be submitted and by when the
fees have to be paid.
Very few candidates identified the Agreement under Article 16(3) PCT benveen the EPO
and the WIPO as legal basis.
Question 4
The question was generally answered well.
With reference to Art. 150(2) EPC it must be taken into account that the priority claim is
made under the PCT. However, the notion of "same invention" is to be interpreted in
accordance with the case law for Article 87(1) EPC (see Art. 27(5) PCT). Nevertheless,
candidates who answered the question by referring only to either Article 87 EPC or Ait. 8
PCT in conjunction with Art 4 Paris Convention were still awarded the marks.
Some candidates wrongly assumed that the later filing of the claims would result in a
re-dating of EP-X according to Rule 56(2) EPC_ This rule is only applicable if parts of the
description or drawings are missing.
Question 5
Most candidates referred to English and Chinese as languages of publication. For full
marks all relevant elements of the contents of the publication had to be identified in detail.
Question 6
Although the majority of candidates drew the correct conclusion, that it is too late to add a
priority claim, a considerable number of candidates overlooked the possibility of requesting
a correction under Rule 139 EPC
Some candidates allocated a single priority date to the whole application instead of
distinguishing between the priorities for Invl and for Inv2
Even though the question did not give any facts supporting a request for re-establishment
of rights in accordance with Article 122 EPC, some candidates lost time by speculating
about this issue.
Some candidates speculated that the priority of Inv2 is valid because it could be derived
from Invl, although there was no basis in the question for such speculation.
Question 7
Most candidates referred to GI/07 and GI/04_ However, not many correctly applied them
to the facts of the question.
A number of candidates missed the fact that the application had not yet been filed and
suggested to insert a disclaimer into a claim.
