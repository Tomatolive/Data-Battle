b) Since both EPI and DIV2 are withdrawn and hence are no longer pending as required
by Rule 36(1) EPC, it is not possible to validly file further divisional applications of EPI or
DIV2
For DIVI , the 24 month time limit set by amended Rule 36(1 )(a) EPC has expired.
Therefore, a divisional application cannot be filed unless the examining division issues a
communication confirming the, or raising another, lack of unity objection, amended Rule
EPC_
Answer to question 3
a) Yes, it is possible. Because the EPO was not ISA, the EPO is competent to carry out a
supplementary international search, Article 3(4) of the Agreement between the EPO and
WIPO (OJ 2010, 307) and Rule and (b) PCT
b) A supplementary international search may be requested at any time prior to the
expiration of 19 months from the priority date, Rule 45bis_ I(a). This period expires on 5
May 2012, extended under Rule 80.5 PCT to 7 May 2012.
The request for a supplementary international search must be filed directly with the 1B,
Rule 45bis. I(b) PCT and should indicate that the EPO should act as SISA, Rule
45bis_ PCT.
The international application was filed in Spanish. Since Spanish is not a language
accepted by the EPO according to the Agreement between the EPO and WIPO, a
translation of the international application in DE, FR or EN has to be filed together with the
request, Rule 45bis.1 (c)(i) PCT
It should be indicated in the request that the second invention should be searched, Rule
45bis_ I(d) PCT
The handling fee and the search fee have to be paid to the 1B within 1 month from receipt
of the request for the supplementary international search Rule 45bis_2 and Rule 45bis.3
PCT.
Answer to question 4
a) No, it is not possible.
Product A1 is not disclosed in EP-X as filed. Thus, the claim directed to product A1 in
PCTI is not in respect of the "same invention" as EP-X, Article 87(1) EPC Therefore a
claim directed to A1 is not entitled to the priority date of EP-X, but has as effective date the
filing date of PCTT The document published in March 2010 is comprised in the state of
the art within the meaning of Article 54(2) EPC_ The claim directed to A1 is not new in view
of the disclosure of this document
b) PCTI was filed within the priority period, which expired on Article 8 PCT
and Alticle 4 Paris Convention. If the draft paper had disclosed A1 , then EP-X would have
disclosed A1 and the priority claim would be valid Therefore, the publication of March
2010 would not be comprised in the state of the an within the meaning of Article 54(2)
EPC and would not be novelty destroying Thus patent protection could be obtained for the
claim directed to product A1
