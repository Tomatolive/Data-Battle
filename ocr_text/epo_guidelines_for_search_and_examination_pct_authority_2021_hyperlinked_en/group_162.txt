5.2 Exemptions from top-up search
March 2021
As a general rule, a top-up search will be conducted for all the claims
forming the basis for the Chapter II examination, as indicated in boxes I and
Ill of the WOIIPER.
A top-up search is not conducted on:
(a)
(b)
(c)
subject-matter not searched by the ISA;
non-unity cases — inventions for which additional search fees were
paid, but not additional examination fees;
subject-matter which, although not excluded from the search, is
excluded from preliminary examination;
In addition to what is mentioned in Rule 60. Iter PCT, the top-up search
may be refused or limited by the EPO as IPEA:
(d)
(f)
where amendments contain added matter;
where there is no letter explaining the basis for amendments and/or
indicating what has been amended in the application;
where the EPO as ISA would not cite any documentary evidence as
to the relevant state of the art (e.g. in case of "notorious knowledge"
in the field of computer-implemented inventions).
In case (d) above, the examiner will perform the top-up search based on
either the previous set of application documents or the amended set,
ignoring the added subject matter. In case (e) above, the same applies to
unsupported amendments (see Gl_JPß.T.-EPQ Q-lll. 4)_
Where a top-up search is made for some claims or part of claims, there is
no indication of:
which claims are not covered by the top-up search (this should be
derivable from the indications in Sections I and Ill of the WO/IPER);
why no or only a partial top-up search has been made.
5.3 Documents newly found in the top-up search, when further
objections are present
If the top-up search reveals pertinent prior art, according to present practice
a WO-IPEA or a telephone consultation is the first action in Chapter II
(see GUPCT-EPO c-IVZ 22). If a positive WO-ISA was drafted or the
objections in the negative WO-ISA have been overcome by the applicant's
amendments/arguments, see GLJPCT-EPO C-IV, 5.4.
