PCT-EPO Guidelines
Pat B -
Chapter XII-3
An example would be that of a document cited in the ISR which could be
used as a Y document for inventive step for some dependent claims in the
Scope Annex. In this case it might be necessary to cite the document again
in the SISR as a Y document for those claims if this was not already
indicated in the main ISR (see also GWPPT.:E-PO 6), and to provide
argumentation in the Scope Annex.
It may also occur that although the EPO as SISA finds further pertinent
prior art, objections may also be raised based on X and/or Y documents
cited in the ISR_ In such a case the examiner may choose to base
objections only on the documents cited in the ISR if considered expedient.
Should the objections correspond to those raised in the WO-ISA from the
main ISA, a mere reference to the WO-ISA objections will suffice.
There may also be cases where the ISR contains documents pertinent for
novelty and/or inventive step and the EPO as SISA cannot find any further
relevant documents (only possibly A documents). In such a case the
following two possibilities will arise:
if the examiner agrees with the categories (X, Y) given in the ISR for
these documents, it is not necessary to cite the documents again in
the SISR. The examiner will then use the documents cited in the ISR
to raise objections of lack of novelty and/or inventive step. If the
WO-ISA from the main ISA has raised the same objections and the
examiner agrees with the given reasoning, a mere reference to the
objections raised in the WO-ISA from the main ISA will suffice.
if the examiner does not agree with some or all of the categories (X,
Y, A) given in the ISR for any such documents considered pertinent
and upon which the examiner wishes to base the objections in the
Scope Annex, such documents will be cited again in the SISR
In both these cases the A documents found by the EPO as SISA will be
cited in the SISR.
Generally, an explicit re-evaluation of the objections raised in the WO-ISA
will be avoided. The examiner will thus refrain from negatively commenting
on any reasoning given in the WO-ISA, bearing in mind that national law
differs amongst the PCT contracting states.
8. Validity of priority and EIP documents
At this stage the priority document should be available in the file and it can
therefore be checked if documents were found during the search.
Should the priority document not be available, for the purposes of the
search the priority is assumed to be valid. No indication in the Scope Annex
IS necessary.
If the priority is not valid, this will be explained in the Scope Annex, and any
P documents found to be relevant will be dealt with in detail.
On the other hand, if the priority is valid, any cited P documents do not
need to be dealt with in detail.
