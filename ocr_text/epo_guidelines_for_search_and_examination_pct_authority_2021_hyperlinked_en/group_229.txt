PCT-EPO Guidelines
11. Lack of unity during the PCT Chapter Jl procedure
If an invitation to pay additional fees was Issued during Ch?pter I and the
applicant paid some or all of the required additional fees, and if, where
applicable, the objection as to lack of unity was at least partly upheld during
a protest procedure, then under Chapter II the applicant will normally be
invited (using Form 405) to pay additional preliminary examination fees if all
the searched inventions are also to be examined under Chapter IL
Inventions for which no search fees were paid cannot be pursued and will
thus also not be objected to or commented on. See GLIPCT-EPO C-V_
