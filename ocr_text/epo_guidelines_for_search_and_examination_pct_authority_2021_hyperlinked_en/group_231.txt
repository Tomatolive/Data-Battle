PCT-EPO Guidelines
Chapter VI — Priority
1. The right to priority
For the establishment of the WO-ISA in relation to the priority claim, see
GUPCT-EPO 4 and subsections.
1.1 Filing date as effective date
See ISPE Guidelines 6_01 and Guidelines 1511 and C.
1.2 Priority date as effective date
When an international application claims the right of priority of the date of
filing of an earlier application, the priority date (ie. the filing date of the
earlier application) will be used to calculate certain time limits.
The priority claim must refer to an earlier applicatiorm The day of filing of the
earlier application not being included in the priority period (Art 812) PCT in
conjunction with Article 4C(2) of the Paris Convention and
Rule PCT), the priority period starts on the day following the date of
filing of the earlier application. Thus, an "earlier" application is to be
understood as an application that has been filed at least a day before the
application claiming priority.
Furthermore, the priority date becomes the effective date for the purposes
of international examination, i.e. the written opinion (of either the ISA or the
IPEA) and the international preliminary' examination report The relevant
date for the purposes of the international search is always the intemational
filing date
See ISPE Guidelines 6_02_
1.3 Validly claiming priority
See ISPE Guidelines 6_03 and 'SPE Guidelines 1511
1.4 Subsequent application considered as first application
See ISPE Guidelines 6_04_
