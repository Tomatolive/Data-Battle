Guidelines for Examination in the EPO
Guidelines, in conformity with the supplementary role of the EPC in the
international phase.
Where the practice for EP and PCT applications is the same (e.g. for the
assessment of novelty), cross-references are made to the EP Guidelines.
Where the practices are only partially overlapping, the information is
contained in full in the PCT-EPO Guidelines in order to avoid possible
confusion. Chapter 3, Annex l, provides an EPC-PCT concordance table.
Any references to persons made in the PCT-EPO Guidelines are to be
understood as being gender-neutral.
2.2 Applicability of the PCT-EPO Guidelines
These Guidelines are intended to cover normal occurrences. They should
therefore be considered only as general instructions. The application of
these Guidelines to individual intemational patent applications is the
responsibility of the formalities and examining staff and they may have to
go beyond these instructions in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, as a
general rule, parties can expect the EPO in its capacity as RO, (S)ISA or
IPEA to act in accordance with these Guidelines until such time as they — or
the relevant legal provisions — are amended. Notices concerning such
amendments are published in the Official Journal of the EPO and on the
EPO website. It should also be noted that these Guidelines do not
constitute legal provisions.
2.3 Relationship between the PCT-EPO Guidelines and the I SPE
Guidelines
The PCT-EPO Guidelines are intended to be complementary to, but not a
substitute for, the PCT ISPEI and RO Guidelines, as well as the PCT
Applicant's Guide ("WIPO PCT Guide") and the Euro-PCT Guide2 ("PCT
procedure at the EPQ [International phase and entry into the European
phase], Guide for applicants").
The ISPE Guidelines published by WIPO set out in detail the procedures
and criteria to be followed by all International Searching and Preliminary
Examining Authorities. Since practice varies amongst different authorities
these Guidelines provide some degrees of freedom as to which
procedure/criteria can be used. Such different criteria are listed in the ISPE
Guidelines in appendices to the respective chapters or defined within a
specific paragraph. Generally, the EPO will use the same criteria when
searching and examining an intemational application as would have been
used in the European procedure This means that where the ISPE
Guidelines are either silent or give no guidance on a particular topic, then
the equivalent provisions of the EP Guidelines are applied mutatis mutandis
to PCT search and preliminary examination. A list of policy options is
provided in section 32 below, Annex II.
