Chapter V-1
Chapter V â€” Unity of invention
1. General remarks
The international application must relate to one invention only or to a group
of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept
When determining unity of invention, a finding of lack of clarity of the claims
is on its own not sufficient grounds for a finding of lack of unity.
Normally, too, the sequence of the claims should not have an impact on the
determination of unity of invention. However, it will have an impact on which
invention is to be considered the first invention mentioned in the claims
(see GUPCT-EPO F--vz 8_2)_
Moreover the fact that the claimed separate inventions belong to different
groups of the classification is not in itself a reason for a finding of lack of
unity.
An application may contain claims of different categories, or several
independent claims of the same categorw This is not in itself a reason for
an objection of lack of unity of invention if the requirements of
Rules 131 to 133 are otherwise met
With regard to substantive criteria, unity of invention is examined in search
and substantive examination in both European and PCT procedures
according to the same principles. This does not apply to the respective
procedures themselves, where significant differences exist (see also
GUPCT-EPO B-VII)_
2. Special technical features
See ISPE Guidelines 10_01 and 10.12-10_16.
See also GUPCT-EPO F-l\..q 3.2 with regard to potential clarity and
conciseness issues for plural independent claims in one category
complying with the requirement of unity of invention.
3. Intermediate and final products
See ISPE Guidelines 10_18.
4. Alternatives
See ISPE Guidelines 10.09.
5. Markush grouping
See ISPE Guidelines 10.17.
There is no need for the significant structural element to be novel in
absolute terms (ie. novel per se)_ Rather, this expression means that in
relation to the common property or activity there must be a common part of
the chemical structure which distinguishes the claimed compounds from
any known compounds having the same property or activity. Howeveq if it
can be shown that at least one Markush alternative is not novel, unity of
