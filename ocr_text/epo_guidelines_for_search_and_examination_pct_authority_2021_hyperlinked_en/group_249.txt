Chapter IV — Prior art
1. General remarks and definition
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G
— Chapter IV-I
An invention is to be "considered novel if it is not anticipated by the prior
art". The "prior art shall consist of everything which has been made
available to the public any.vhere in the world by means of written disclosure
(including drawings and other illustrations) and which is capable of being of
assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is not new and
that it does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is not
obvious), provided that the making available to the public occurred prior to
the international filing The scope of this definition should be noted.
There are no restrictions whatsoever as to the geographical location where
or the language in which the relevant information was made available to the
public; also no age limit is stipulated for the documents or other sources of
the information.
See also ISPE Guidelines 11.01 and ISPE Guidelines 11.12
The principles to be applied in determining whether other kinds of prior art,
e.g. relating to use (which could be introduced e.g by a third party, see
GUPCT-EPO ISPE Guidelines 16.57 and PCT/AI section 801), have
been made available to the public are govemed by Rules 33. I(ö) and 64.2_
For the examination of the novelty of claimed subject-matter,
see GUPCT-EPO G-VI.
A written description, i.e. a document, should be regarded as made
available to the public if, at the relevant date, it was possible for members
of the public to gain knowledge of the content of the document and there
was no bar of confidentiality restricting the use or dissemination of such
knowledge. For instance German utility models ("Gebrauchsmustet') are
already publicly available as of their date of entry in the Register of utility
models ("Eintragungstag"), which precedes the date of announcement in
the Patent Bulletin ("Bekanntmachung im Patentblatt").
2. Enabling disclosures
The principles as laid down in section G-IV, 2, in the Guidelines for
Examination in the apply mutatis mutandis_
3. Date of filing or priority date as effective date
It should be noted that for the purpose of intemational preliminary'
examination all prior art is taken into account which was publicly available
before the international filing date or, where a priority has been validly
claimed, before the date of priority. It should be remembered that different
claims, or different altematives claimed in one claim, may have different
effective dates, i.e the date of filing or (one of) the claimed priority date(s).
The question of novelty must be considered against each claim (or part of a
claim where a claim specifies a number of alternatives) and prior art in
relation to one claim or one part of a claim may include matter, e.g. an
intermediate document (see GL/?CT-EPO B-X. 9.2_4), which cannot be
