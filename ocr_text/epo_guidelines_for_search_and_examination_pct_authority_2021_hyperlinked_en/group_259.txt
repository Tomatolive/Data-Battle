Chapter VI — Novelty
1. Prior art pursuant to
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Under the PCT, an invention is considered to be novel if it is not anticipated
by the prior art Everything which is made available to the public anynvhere
in the world by means of a written disclosure is considered prior art
provided that such making available occurred prior to the relevant date In
cases where the making available to the public occurred by non-written
means, it constitutes prior art only if a written disclosure that occurred
before the relevant date confirms the non-written disclosure. The relevant
date is the intemational filing date or, where at least one priority has been
validly claimed, the date of the earliest priority. It should be noted that in
considering novelty (as distinct from inventive step), it is not permissible to
combine separate items of prior art together. It is also not permissible to
combine separate items belonging to dfferent embodiments described in
one and the same document, unless such combination has specifically
been suggested, see also ISPE Guidelines 12.06.
For the specific case of selection inventions see ISPS Guidelines 12.10_
Furthermore, any matter explicitly disclaimed (with the exception of
disclaimers which exclude unworkable embodiments) and prior art
acknowledged in a document, insofar as explicitly described therein, are to
be regarded as incorporated in the document
It is further permissible to use a dictionary or similar document of reference
in order to interpret a special term used in a document
2. Implicit features or well-known equivalents
A document takes away the novelty of any claimed subject-matter derivable
directly and unambiguously from that document including any features
implicit to a person skilled in the art in what is expressly mentioned in the
document, e.g. a disclosure of the use of rubber in circumstances where
clearly its elastic properties are used even if this is not explicitly stated
takes away the novelty of the use of an elastic material. The limitation to
subject-matter "derivable directly and unambiguously" from the document is
important. Thus, when considering novelty, it is not correct to interpret the
teaching of a document as embracing well-known equivalents which are not
disclosed in the documents; this is a matter of inventive step.
3. Relevant date of a prior document
In determining novelty, a prior document should be read as it would have
been read by a person skilled in the art on the relevant date of the
document. For the purpose of assessing novelty the "relevant" date for
written disclosures is the date as defined by Rule 64. I(b), i.e. either the
international filing date of the application under consideration or, if a priority
has been validly claimed, the application date of that earlier application (if
the filing date of the application is within the two-month period after the
expiry of the priority period of the earlier application, the relevant date is
also the application date of that earlier application); for non-written
disclosures see Rules 331 (b) and 64.2.
