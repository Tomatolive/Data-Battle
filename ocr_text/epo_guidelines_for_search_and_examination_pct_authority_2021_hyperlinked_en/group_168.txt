5.1 Admissibility of the protest as checked by the formalities officer
Before initiating the protest procedure the formal admissibility of the protest
in the sense of Rule 68_3(c) (Chapter II) must be checked.
To be admissible the protest should satisfy the following requirements.
(a)
(b)
The applicant must have paid the prescribed protest fee
(Rule 68.3(e)), and
The payment under protest must be accompanied by a reasoned
statemenv i.e. the reasoned statement should have been filed with
the payment or at the latest within the time limit set in Form 405
[Qhap!er. II).
The reasoned statement must comply with Rule 68.30; i.e. applicants
should argue why the international application complies with the
requirement of unity of invention or why the amount of the required
additional fee is excessive. In the protest applicants should question the
number of additional examination fees that they have been invited to pay,
and not the amount of a single additional fee.
The payment of the protest fee and the filing of a purported reasoned
statement are assessed by specially trained formalities officers. If the
formalities officer finds any deficiencies, the applicant is informed of them
by way of Form 420 or Form 424. Any substantive analysis is made by the
Review Panel when assessing the justification of the protest
5.2 The work of the Review Panel
For the composition and purpose of the Review Panel, see
GLIPCT-EPO B-VIIz 7_2_ The names of the members of the Review Panel
are made public on Form 420.
The scope of the review is limited to those inventions for which additional
fees have been paid If the applicant's reasoning is not related to those
inventions, the Review Panel will come to the conclusion that the protest is
not or is only partially justifie4 depending on the case.
If the Review Panel determines that the protest is wholly justified, it will
inform the applicant with Form 420 (Decision on Protest Chapter II) This
also applies if the Review Panel's finding results in the application not
lacking unity. It is not necessary to give any reasoning unless the Review
Panel decides that such reasoning would be beneficial. Furthermore the
Review Panel will order the reimbursement of all the additional fees and the
protest fee. The examination will be carried out on the inventions for which
the fees are paid, and the non-unity reasoning and the number of
inventions in the IPER (or WO-IPEA) will be adapted to the Review Panel's
decision.
If the Review Panel considers that the protest is not justified at all, it will
communicate this to the applicant using Form 420_ Reasoning must be
given, indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is upheld
