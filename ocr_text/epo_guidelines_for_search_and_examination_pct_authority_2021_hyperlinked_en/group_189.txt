PCT-EPO Guidelines
Pan E
Chapter II-I
Chapter II — Observations by third parties
Third parties may, anonymously if so desireå file observations under the
PCT which, unlike observations under the EPC, should exclusively refer to
prior an relevant to the novelty and/or inventive step of the invention
claimed in the international application.
The observations are to be submitted electronically to the 1B using the
online tool provided by WIPO between the date of intemational publication
and 28 months from the priority date of the international application. They
may be filed in any language of publication; the cited prior art may be in any
language. For more details, see the guide entitled "ePCT Third Party
Observations" published by WIPO_
The applicant is notified by the Intemational Bureau (1B) of any such
observations and may file comments within 30 months from the priority
date.
The 1B will promptly communicate any third-party observation and any
comment by the applicant to the ISA the SISA and the IPEA, unless the
(supplementary') intemational search report or the international preliminary
examination report (IPER) has already been received by the 1B.
Promptly after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date, the third-
party observation(s) and the applicant's comment(s) will be sent to all
designated Offices and elected Offices. The EPO as designated/elected
Office will consider a third-party observation filed during the international
phase after entry' into the European phase as to its contents once that
observation becomes available to it However, the EPO will only make
even/ effot-t to issue the next offce action within three months of expiry of
the period under Rule 161 EPC on condition that the third party has clearly
expressed its wish that such action be taketm and that the observation was
substantiated and not filed anonymously. A third party wishing to achieve
the above-mentioned result in the European phase should, therefore, make
this clear in the observation or else file the observation with the EPO as
designated/elected Office (see also GLIEPO E--VI, 3, last paragraph).
Any third-party observations/comments thereto will be made available for
public inspection.
If the third-party observations and/or prior art are not in an official EPO
language, the formalities officer at the EPO will invite the third party to
submit a translation of the observations and/or the prior an in line with the
European procedure (GUEPO E-Vl, 3), but setting a shorter time limit
within the boundaries of the required strict PCT deadlines. No invitation is
issued if these deadlines cannot be respected or if the third-party
observations were filed anonymously.
If the third-party observations and/or prior art are not in an official EPO
language and a translation is not or cannot be filed, the examiner should
nevertheless take them into account to the extent that this is feasible, in
particular when they seem to be prima facie relevant (e.g. from the
A1 801-805
GUISPE 15.58, 16.57
and 17.69
Rule 483
Art 14111 EPC
