2.1 Applications containing missing parts or elements, or correct
parts or elements, incorporated by reference
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire
element(s) thereof (i.e all of the description and/or all of the claims), they
may still furnish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and Rule 20.6(a) and
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) completely
contained in the priority document
Similarly, if applicants appear to have erroneously filed part(s) of the
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (i.e all of the description
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or
element(s) at a later date without affecting the intemational filing date
subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 206(a) and provided the
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority
document.
The notification of incompatibility filed by the EPO as RO regarding
Rule and (d) (see GLIPCT-EPO A-IL 6) does not have any
impact on the activity of the EPO as ISA which depends on the decisions
taken by the RO with regard to the international application and its filing
date. Therefore, in cases where the international application was corrected
by the RO under Rulz2g_5bis, the EPO as ISA will establish the written
opinion on the basis of the international application including the correct
element(s) and/or part(s) if:
(a)
(b)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s)
before the start of the search; or
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) after
the stan of the search (including after its completion) and the
applicant pays an additional fee equal to the search fee within
one month of the date of the invitation to do so issued by the
EPO [Rule 40bis.1
and Article 2(1) Rfees) ( ee
GUPCT-EPO B-llL 2.3.4)_
See GUPCT-EPO 23.3.
The examiner must check (as far as the documents needed are available)
whether the RO'S assessment of the "completely contained" criterion was
correct (see GUPCT-EPO See also GWPCT-EPO a-ill* 2.33,
and GUPCT-EPO H-IL 2_2.22, for the impact on the search report and

2.2 Applications filed in Dutch
The EPO acting as ISA accepts intemational applications drawn up in
Dutch if the application was filed with the Netherlands patent office as RO_
Therefore, for such files, a translation is not required for the purpose of the
international search by the EPO as ISA. However, under Rule 124(a),
within 14 months of the priority date, a translation must be filed with the RO
in a language of publication accepted by the RO for the purpose of
