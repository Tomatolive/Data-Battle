international publication, i.e. English, French or German in the case of the
Netherlands patent office as RO The EPO as ISA will establish the ISR
and WO-ISA in that language if it is already known at the time of carrying
out the international search; othervvise they will be in the language of the
request form, i.e. English, French or German. See also PCT Applicant's

3. Analysis of the application and content of the written opinion
3.1 The examiners dossier
Section 3-XI„ 3.1. in the Gujdeljnes for Examinatjon in the EPO applies
mutatis mutandis
3.2 Reasoned objections
3.2.1 Opinion on novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability
The opinion given in the WO-ISA is restricted to what has actually been
searched; this should also be made clear in the WO-ISA
A full explanation of the conclusions reached should always be given for all
searched claims, regardless of whether this conclusion is positive or
negative. Normally only one independent claim in each category is treated
in detail; for negative conclusions regarding further independent claims, as
well as for dependent claims, comments may be shorter
3.2.2 Multiple independent claims
Multiple independent claims in one category are per se not a reason for a
restriction of the search (see GLIPCT-EPO B-VIIIZ 4).
If appropriate, an objection as to clarity and conciseness under Article 6
may be made under Box VIII (see GLIPCT-EPO F-IVZ 32). As an
alternative, for cases where multiple independent claims in one category do
not affect the clarity of the definition of the invention, a minor objection may
be raised under Box VII.
3.2.3 Dependent claims — WO-ISA
Dependent claims should be indicated as complying or not with the
requirements of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability Short
statements of the reasons why the claims do not comply with these
requirements should be given on the separate sheet At the discretion of
the examiner, more detailed comments may be made about selected
dependent claims. If any claims are found to be novel and inventive, brief
reasons for this too should be given on the separate sheet
3.2.4 Clarity, conciseness, support and formal defects — WO-ISA
Major clarity, conciseness or support issues will be mentioned under
Box VIII, unless they result in a meaningful search being impossible, in
which case they will be treated under Section Ill.
