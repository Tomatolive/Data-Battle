PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part E
— Chapter Ill-I
Chapter Ill — Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)
1. General
The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) enables an applicant whose claims
have been determined to be patentable/allowable to have a corresponding
application which has been filed with a PPH partner office processed in an
accelerated manner while at the same time allowing the offices involved to
exploit available work results.
Currently, the EPO's PPH partner offices are: JPO (Japan), KIPO (South
Korea), CNIPA (China), USPTO (USA), ILPO (Israel), CIPO (Canada), IMPI
(Mexico), IPOS (Singapore), IPA (Australia) SIC (Colombia), ROSPATENT
(Russian Federation), MylPO (Malaysia), IPOPHL (Philippines), EAPO
(Eurasia), INPI (Brazil) and INDECOPI (Peru).
Under the PPH pilot programme a PPH request can be based on:
(i) the latest PCT work product (WO-ISA or IPRP/IPER) established by
one of the PPH partner offices as ISA or IPEA (PPH based on PCT
work products) (except under the PPH pilot programme with INPI
(Brazil)); or
any national work product (office action
indicating
patentable/allowable claims) established during the processing of a
national application or of a PCT application that has entered the
national phase before one of the PPH partner offices (PPH based on
national work products).
