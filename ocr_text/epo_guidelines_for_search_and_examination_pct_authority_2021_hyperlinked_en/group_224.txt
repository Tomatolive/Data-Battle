Part F â€” Chapter IV-IO
GUISPE 412 558
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2021
An objection under both Art 5 and Art 6 may also be justified. An example
would be a claim relating to a known class of chemical compounds defined
by measurable parameters, when the description does not disclose a
technical teaching allowing the skilled person to manufacture those
compounds complying with the parametric definition, and this is not
othemise feasible by the application of common general knowledge or
routine experimentation. Such a claim would be both technically not
supported and not sufficiently disclosed, regardless of whether the
parametric definition meets the clarity requirement of Alt. 6.
