invention mentioned in the invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) and
for which the search fee has been paid. Section IV is filled out and the
reasons for lack of unity are given on the separate sheet.
If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant restricted the claims,
the examiner has to check whether the restricted set of claims is unitary
and whether all claims relate to searched subject-matter.
If this is the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the restricted set of
claims, and Section IV is not filled out.
If this is not the case, the WO-IPEA\IPER is established on the main or first
invention mentioned in Form 405 and for which the search fee has been
paid; Section IV is filled ouv and any claims relating to non-searched
subject-matter are indicated in Section Ill.
4.2 Payment of additional examination fees without protest
If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant pays additional
preliminary examination fees without protest, the WO-IPEA\IPER is
established on the basis of those inventions for which examination fees
have been paid. Section IV is filled out and the reasons for lack of unity are
given on the separate sheet.
If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant restricted the claims
and paid additional fees, the examiner has to verify that the restricted set of
claims does not contain more inventions than those for which additional
fees have been paid and that the restricted claims relate to subject-matter
that has been searched.
If this is the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the restricted set of
claims, and Section IV is filled out.
If this is not the case, the WO-IPEA\IPER is established on as many
inventions mentioned in Form 405 as additional fees have been paid for.
Section IV is filled out and any claims relating to unsearched subject-matter
are indicated in Section Ill.
In both cases the reasons for the lack of unity are given on the separate
sheet
4.3 Payment of additional examination fees under protest
In reply to Form 405, applicants may pay some or all of the additional fees
under protest. If they do so, then this triggers the protest procedure for
determining whether the request for payment of the additional fees was
justified (see also GWPCT-EPO C-V, 5).
5. Protest procedure
The protest procedure consists of a review within the IPEA first by the
formalities officer and then by a Review Panel.
