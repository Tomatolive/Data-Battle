PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B
— Chapter VIII-I
Chapter VIII — Subject-matter to be excluded
from the search
1. General remarks
The aim of the EPO as ISA is to issue international search reports which
are as complete as possible. Nevertheless, there are situations in which the
search report and the written opinion cover only part of the subject-matter
claimed, or in which no search report is issued. This may be either because
the international application includes subject-matter which the ISA is not
required to deal with (see GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII, 2) or else because the
description, claims or drawings fail to meet a requirement, such as clarity or
support of the claims by the description, to such an extent that no
meaningful search can be made of all or some of the claims (see
GLIPCT-EPO a-VIII, 3). Applications of the latter kind are often referred to
as "complex applications"
The same approach is taken as for European applications.
In principle, a declaration of no search under Art. should remain
an exception. Under the PCT, even if the applicant amends the claims to
overcome the objection, an additional search is not possible. When a
declaration of no search is issue4 the search must be performed at the
examination stage without requesting an additional fee if the international
application enters the European phase before the EPO and if the objection
leading to the declaration has been overcome (GI_/EPO C-lV2 7.2).
Therefore, at least some effort should be made to carry out a meaningful
search of at least part of the claimed subject-matter.
2. Subject-matter which the ISA is not required to search and
examine
Art and Art together with and are the
equivalents of Alt 52(2), 13) and 53(b), 'c) EPC conceming the exclusion
from patentability of non-technical inventions programs for computers,
methods of doing business medical methods and the exception to
patentability for plant or animal varieties or essentially biological processes
for the production of plants and animals, respectively. Since the PCT
procedure does not lead to a grant, subject-matter which would be
excluded from patentability under the EPC is identified as subject-matter for
which the ISA and/or the 'PEA is not required to carry out search and
international preliminary examination.
The criteria applied for the decision not to perform an international search
are the same as for the European procedure. This means that the
discretion of an ISA not to search subject-matter set forth in Rule 39.1 is
exercised by the EPO as ISA only to the extent that such subject-matter is
not searched under the provisions of the EPC
For subject-matter which the ISA is not required to search under
Art and where, as a consequence, an incomplete search report
will be issued, the restriction should always be indicated both in the search
report and in the WO-ISA
