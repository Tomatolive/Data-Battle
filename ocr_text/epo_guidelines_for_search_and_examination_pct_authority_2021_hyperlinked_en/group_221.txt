4.18 Reference signs
PCT-EPO Guidelines
See ISPE Guidelines 5.11.
If there is a large number of different
embodiments, only the reference signs of the most important embodiments
need be incorporated in the independent claim(s).
If text is added to reference signs in parentheses in the claims, lack of
clarity can arise (Art 6)_ Expressions such as "securing means (screw 13,
nail 14)" or "valve assembly (valve seat 23, valve element 27, valve
seat 28)" are not reference signs in the sense of Rule 62(b) but are special
features It is unclear whether the features added to the reference signs are
limiting or not. Accordingly, such bracketed features are generally not
permissible. However, additional references to those figures, where
particular reference signs are to be found, such as "(13 - Figure 3;
14 - Figure 4)", are unob]ectionable_
A lack of clarity can also arise with bracketed expressions that do not
include reference signs, e.g. "(concrete) moulded brick". In contrast,
bracketed expressions with a generally accepted meaning are allowable,
e.g. "(meth)acrylate" which is known as an abbreviation for "acrylate and
methacrylate". The use of brackets in chemical or mathematical formulae is
also unobjectionable. The use of brackets for providing physical values
complying with the requirements of Rule 10_1 is unobjectionable as well.
4.19 Negative limitations (e.g. disclaimers)
A clam's subject-matter is normally defined in terms of positive features
indicating that certain technical elements are present. Exceptionally,
however, the subject-matter may be restricted using a negative limitation
expressly stating that particular features are absent This may be done
e.g. if the absence of a feature can be deduced from the application as
Negative limitations such as disclaimers may be used only if adding
positive features to the claim either would not define more clearly and
concisely the subject-matter still protectable or would unduly limit the
scope of the claim. It has to be clear what is excluded by means of the
disclaimer A claim containing one or more disclaimers must also fully
comply with the clarity and conciseness requirements of Art 6.
For the allowability of disclaimers excluding embodiments that were
disclosed in the original application as being part of the see
