4. Priority claim and the WO-ISA
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Normally, priority need only be checked if a relevant P or E document is
found during the search However, there may also be cases where the
examiner immediately realises that the priority is not valid (eg_ in the case
of an alleged doublure (see GLIPCT-EPO B-lVl 1 M) or a continuation-in
part (see GUPCT-EPO F-VII 1.4)). Also, in case of restoration of priority
rights the examiner may insert a comment in Box II (see
4.1).
4.1 Restoration of priority
See GUPCT-EPO F--vtz 3.7.
If the examiner notices that the filing date exceeds the earliest priority date
plus twelve and two months this may be indicated in the WO-ISA.
4.2 use of "P' documents in the written opinion
If the priority document IS not available the opinion will be established on
the assumption that the claimed priority is valid. In this case, no comments
need be made regarding 'P" documents but the "P" documents will
nevertheless be indicated under Section VI. For potentially conflicting
patent documents which might give rise to an objection under Art 54(3)
EPC in the European phase, the statements in GWPCT-EPO B-XI, 4.30
below regarding "E" documents apply.
If the priority document is available, the examiner will check the validity of
the priority and indicate any negative finding under Section II. Should the
priority be found not to be valid, detailed comments will be made for these
documents with respect to novelty and inventive step of the claimed
subject-matter under Section V, since these documents then become prior
art under Rule 33.1 (a).
Sometimes it is possible for the examiner to determine from the documents
on file that the claimed priority is not valid. An example would be when
during the search a document is found which shows that the priority
document of the searched application is actually not the first application for
the claimed invention.
4.3 use of "E' documents in the written opinion
Although there are no harmonised provisions in the PCT Contracting States
that correspond to Alt 54(3) EPC, such documents will be mentioned
under Section VI if they are considered prejudicial to the novelty of at least
one claim. If the relevance of the document is independent of the priority
being valid or if the priority could be checked and was found invalid,
reasons for the novelty objection will be provided, together with an
indication that such a document would be relevant when entering the
European phase before the EPO.
On the other hand, if the document would be relevant under Art 54(3) EPC
only if the priority is not valid, and this could not be checked, then no
reasons need to be given.
