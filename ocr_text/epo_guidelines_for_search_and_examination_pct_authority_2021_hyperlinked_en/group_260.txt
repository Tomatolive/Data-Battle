4. Enabling disclosure of a prior document
March 2021
Subject-matter described in a document can only be regarded as having
been made available to the public, and therefore as comprised in the prior
art pursuant to Rules 33 and 64, if the information given therein to the
skilled person is sufficient to enable them, at the relevant date of the
document, to practise the technical teaching which is the subject of the
document, taking into account also the general knowledge at that time in
the field to be expected of them.
Similarly, it should be noted that a chemical compound, the name or
formula of which is mentioned in a prior-art document, is not thereby
considered as known, unless the information in the document, together,
where appropriate, with knowledge generally available on the relevant date
of the document, enables it to be prepared and separated or, for instance in
the case of a product of nature, only to be separated.
The EPO applies option A12_02L1] of the Appendix to Chapter 12 of the
'SPE Guidelines.
5. Generic disclosure and specific examples
In considering novelty, it should be borne in mind that a generic disclosure
does not usually take away the novelty of any specific example falling
within the terms of that disclosure, but that a specific disclosure does take
away the novelty of a generic claim embracing that disclosure, e.g. a
disclosure of copper takes away the novelty of metal as a generic concept,
but not the novelty of any metal other than copper, and one of rivets takes
away the novelty of fastening means as a generic concept but not the
novelty of any fastening other than rivets
6. Implicit disclosure and parameters
In the case of a prior document, the lack of novelty may be apparent from
what is explicitly stated in the document itself Alternativelyq it may be
implicit in the sense that, in carrying out the teaching of the prior document,
the skilled person would inevitably arrive at a result falling within the terms
of the claim. An objection of lack of novelty of this kind should be raised by
the examiner only where there can be no reasonable doubt as to the
practical effect of the prior teaching. Situations of this kind may also occur
when the claims define the invention, or a feature thereof, by parameters It
may happen that in the relevant prior art a different parameter, or no
parameter at all, is mentioned. If the known and the claimed products are
identical in all other respects (which is to be expected if, for example, the
starting products and the manufacturing processes are identical), then in
the first place an objection of lack of novelty arises. The burden of proof for
an alleged distinguishing feature lies with the applicant No benefit of doubt
can be accorded if the applicant does not provide evidence in support of
the allegations. If, on the other hand, the applicant is able to show, e.g. by
appropriate comparison tests, that differences do exist with respect to the
parameters, it is questionable whether the application discloses all the
features essential to manufacture products having the parameters specified
in the claims (Art 5)
