PCT-EPO Guidelines
Chapter XII â€” Supplementary international
search (SIS)
1. General
The supplementary international search system is optional for both
applicants and International Authorities. Its purpose is to enable applicants,
during the intemational phase, to obtain further supplementary searches
from other Authorities so that they have a better basis for deciding whether
or not to enter the regional phase.
The EPO as SISA only accepts a limited number of SIS requests per year.
Since 2010, the EPO has limited the number of SIS requests it will accept
to 700 per year.
2. Time limits
An applicant can request a SIS up to the end of 22 months from the priority
date The request must be filed with the 1B.
The SISA must start the search promptly after receipt of the necessary
documents, though it may delay the start of the search until it has received
the ISR from the main ISA, but not later than the end of 22 months from the
priority date
The supplementary' international search report (SISR) must be established
within 28 months from the priority date so as to allow the applicant to take it
into account when deciding whether or not to enter the regional/national
phase.
The file will therefore be sent to the examiner as soon as all the documents
have been received, including the ISR from the main ISA. If, however, the
ISR from the main ISA is not received within 22 months of the priority date,
the file will be sent to the examiner to enable the stan of the search.
3. Basis for the search
The SIS is always made on the claims as originally filed (or a translation
thereof), irrespective of whether amendments have been filed under Art 19
or 34_
4. Scope of the search
At the EPO the scope of a SIS is the same as for any other intemational
search carried out by the EPO as ISA and is not limited to documentation in
a specific language
If an ISR from the main ISA is already available when the examiner carries
out the SIS, it will be taken into account when establishing the SISR and
written opinion.
