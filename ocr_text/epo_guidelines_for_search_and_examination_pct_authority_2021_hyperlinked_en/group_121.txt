PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B
â€” Chapter VIII-9
Generally, an opinion must be given on all searched claims. Only one
independent claim in each category needs to be treated in detail; shod
comments would normally suffice for further independent claims.
Furthermore, if appropriate, an objection as to clarity and conciseness
under Arti* E may be made under Box VIII of the WO-ISA The EPO as
ISA may exercise its discretion to ask the applicant to clarify the subject
matter to be searched, applying the same procedure as described under
GUPCT-EPO a-VIII. 3.3 - GUPCT-EPO 3.4.
