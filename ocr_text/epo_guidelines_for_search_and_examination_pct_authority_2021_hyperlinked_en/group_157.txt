PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
— Chapter 'V-1
Chapter IV — Examination of the WO-ISA and
replies
1. General procedure
Under Chapter II, the reply to the WO-ISA WO-IPEA (Form 408) or
telephone minutes with possible amendments will be examined.
The final result of this examination under Chapter II is the issuance of the
IPER (see GUPCT-EPO C-VIII).
The examiner will first consider whether the objections raised in the
WO-ISA have been overcome by the submitted arguments and/or
amendments. If this is the case the IPER will be issued directly, provided
that the top-up search does not yield any pertinent prior art
(see WPC.T.-EPO Q-IY, 5-4)_ If objections have not been overcome or if
pertinent prior art is found in the top-up search (see GWPß.T.-E-PO Q-IY,
and 5_4), a further WO-IPEA or telephone minutes should be issued as set
out in GUPCT-EPO c-IV. 2.2
If a further WO-IPEA or telephone minutes setting a time limit for reply are
issued, the examiner will examine any reply from the applicant and will then
as a rule draft the IPER directly even if objections still occur, unless there is
outstanding request for
telephone
consultation
(see GUPCT-EPO c-IV, 2.2, and c-VII, 1). An exception could be f it is
clear that minor amendments could be suggested during e.g a short
telephone consultation which would result in a positive 'PER, so that it
would appear procedurally expedient to solve these problems in the
Chapter II phase.
2. Despatch of a further written opinion (Form 408)
2.1 Procedure when the EPO was not the ISA
Where the ISR and WO-ISA were established by another European
International Searching Authority (at present SE, ESi AT, Fl, TR, NPI (XN)
and VPI (XV)), the WO-ISA is not considered as the first written opinion for
the procedure under Chapter II PCT and the examiner will examine the file,
taking into account the WO-ISA and any reply from the applicant on file. If
there are objections as to novelty, inventive step and/or industrial
applicability, the examiner will send a WO-IPEA with a time limit for the
applicant to reply as laid down in Rue. which is normally
two months.
If, despite the applicant's timely and substantive reply (in the form of
amendments and/or arguments) to this there are still objections
outstanding possibly resulting from the top-up search in Chapter II
(see GUPCT-EPO C-IV, 5), a further witten opinion or telephone minutes
are issued as set out under GLIPCT-EPO C-IV, 22
2.2 Procedure when the EPO was the ISA
Applicants must be given a further opportunity for interaction in Chapter. II
before a negative IPER is established, on condition that they have filed in
