3. The title
The items making up the request do not normally concern the examiner,
with the exception of the title. Rule 5.1(a) stipulates that the description
"shall first state the title of the invention as appearing in the request".
The title must be short and precise. The examiner reviews the title in the
light of the description and claims and any amendments thereto, to make
sure that the title, as well as being concise gives a clear and adequate
indication of the subject of the invention. Thus if amendments are made
which change the categories of claims, the examiner should check whether
a corresponding amendmenv which may not go beyond the disclosure in
the intemational application as filed, is needed in the title (see also
GWPCT-EPO 7). See also GWPCT-EPO H-lllz 7.
For further provisions specifically related to the title, see
'SPE Guidelines 16.35 - 16_38.
