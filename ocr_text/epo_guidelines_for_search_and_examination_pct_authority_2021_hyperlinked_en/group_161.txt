PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
— Chapter IV-5
If the reply contains amended claims introducing unsearched matter, the
applicant will be informed in the IPER (under Section III) that an opinion
cannot be given for unsearched matter.
As explained in GLJPCT-EPO B-VIII, 1, an additional search may be made
after entry' into the European phase, in the examination phase, if the
reasons for restricting the search can be overcome (see also GWE-PO
C-JV, 7.2). This additional search is at no additional cost to the applicant.
4.2 Consequences of a declaration of no search or an incomplete
search in subsequent European procedure
For unsearched subject-matter, no written opinion is established under PCT.
Chap.ter.l and no examination is carried out under..
Furthermore, there is no possibility to appeal the decision of the ISA (see
GLIPCT-EPO C-IV. so that even if the applicant were to succeed in
convincing the examiner under Chapter II that the decision not to search
certain subject-matter was incorrect, this has no consequences However,
in the European procedure the examining division must review the decision
of the search division (examiner) and take a final decisiorm This implies that
in the European phase for the Euro-PCT application the examiner might
have to reverse the decision of the ISA and perform a complete search
(either because of the arguments filed or because of the clams having
been redrafted so that a search can now be performed, see also
GUEPO c-IV, 7_2)_
5. Top-up searches in PG_T_ Chapter II
A top-up search is mandatory at the outset of PCT Chapter II, subject to
some exceptions (see GUPCT-EPO C-IV: 5_2)_ The date — or absence — of
this top-up search must be indicated in the IPER
5.1 Timing, basis and forms
The top-up search will be conducted before/at the same time as issuing the
first WO-IPEA (Form 408)/telephone consultation or, where no written
opinion is produced, the IPER (Form 409) (approximately within a month of
the stan of international preliminary examination) A further top-up search
before issuance of the 'PER is normally not necessary.
In the case of non-unity where there is more than one invention claimed for
which examination under Chapter II is demanded, the examiner will first
issue an invitation to pay additional examination fees (Form 405) and then
perform the top-up search for all inventions for which additional
examination fees have been paid.
The IPEA must indicate in the IPER whether or not a top-up search has
been done The date indicated in the form is the date of the latest top-up
search. The box which indicates that no top-up search has been done is
only ticked if all the claims are exempted from top-up search.
