reported on in the written opinion and/or IPER, as appropriate. These
include substantive requirements such as sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 5),
clarity of the claims (Art. 6) and unity of invention (Rule 13) as well as
formal requirements such as the numbering of the claims (Rule 6.1) and the
form of the drawings (Rule 11.10 to 11.13). These requirements are dealt
with in the present Pan F
