â€” Chapter VIII-5
3.1 Examples of impossibility to perform a meaningful search over
the whole of the claimed scope
A number of non-limiting examples will illustrate where a restriction of the
search may find application:
claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure
(iii)
One example would be a claim so broadly formulated that at least
part of its scope is speculative, i.e. not supported by the disclosure of
the application. In this case the broadness of the claim is such as to
render a meaningful search over the whole of the claim impossible,
and a meaningful search can be performed only on the basis of the
narroweq disclosed invention, for example only on the basis of that
part of the claim which is supported. In extreme cases, this may
mean a search directed to only one or more of the specific examples
disclosed in the description The examiner should bear in mind that
the requirements under Alt 5 and 6 concerning sufficiency of
disclosure and support should be seen from the perspective of the
person skilled in the art.
claims lacking conciseness
An example would be where there are so many claims, or so many
possibilities within a claim, that it becomes unduly burdensome to
determine the matter for which protection is sought (for the case of
multiple independent claims
in the same category
see GLIPCT-EPO a-VIII, 4). A complete search (or any search at all)
may de facto be impossible.
It is noted that the EPO allows multiple dependent claims, provided
that they do not detract from the clarity of the claims as a whole and
that the arrangement of claims does not create obscurity in the
definition of the subject-matter to be protected (see also
GLIPCT-EPO F-IVL 3.4). In case of unclarity, it may be appropriate
for the examiner to first invite the applicant for informal clarification
before the search is carried out (see GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3_6)_
claims lacking clarity
An example would be where the applicant's choice of parameter to
define the invention renders a meaningful comparison with the prior
art impossible, perhaps because the prior art has not employed the
same parameter, or has employed no parameter at all. In such a
case, the parameter chosen by the applicant may lack clarity
(see Art. 6; cf. GUPCT-EPO 4.11)_ It may be that the lack of
clarity of the parameter is such as to render a meaningful search of
the claims or of a claim or of a part of a claim impossible because
the choice of parameter renders a sensible comparison of the
claimed invention with the prior art impossible. If so, the search may
possibly be restricted to the worked examples, as far as they can be
understood, or to the way in which the desired parameter is obtained.
