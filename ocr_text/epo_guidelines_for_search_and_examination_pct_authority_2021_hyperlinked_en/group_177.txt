Chapter VIII - The IPER
1. Opinion given in the 'PER (Form 409)
Art 35(2) specifies that the report shall not contain any statement on the
question of whether the claimed invention is or seems to be patentable or
unpatentable according to any national law. Moreover, the purpose of the
preliminary examination is merely to give an opiniorm but it does not lead to
a grant or a refusal of the application. In these circumstances, therefore,
the report should not give the impression that any part of the application
may or may not be allowable It will only state whether or not the claims
meet certain criteria
2. Completing the 'PER
The IPER is drafted in the same way as the WO-ISA, i.e. a positive or
negative opinion will be given for all claims, taking into account the
arguments and/or amendments submitted by the applicant
Therefore, the same criteria apply to the IPER as to the WO-ISA with
respect to all examination issues (see also GUPCT-EPO B-XI).
In particular the 'PER will only be established for claims which have been
searched (as indicated in the WO-ISA); any amended claims that are
directed to subject-matter not searched will not be considered and an
indication will be made in Section III of the IPER (non-establishment of
opinion), with reasons given on the separate sheet
If no reply has been received to a written opinion or the objections raised
a previous written opinion are still valid, the comments contained in that
written opinion can be transferred to the corresponding section in the IPER
However, if the applicant has submitted arguments in favour of the claims,
then even if the objections previously raised are still valid, the examiner
should, in a neutral way (ie_ without direct reference to the letter of reply in
the sense of "see reply/arguments from the applicant"), deal with at least
the main arguments from the applicant in order to ensure that the applicant
knows that the arguments made have been considered.
If arguments, facts and evidence, such as the results of a comparative test,
produced by an applicant in response to a written opinion are of crucial
importance in assessing inventive step, the examiner may base the
argumentation in the IPER on the applicant's response. This is of
importance to other offices which need to know why a particular conclusion
has been reached. However, since the IPER should be written in a neutral
way and should be self-contained, the examiner should not append to the
IPER portions of the applicant's reply or refer directly to the applicant's
letter of reply.
