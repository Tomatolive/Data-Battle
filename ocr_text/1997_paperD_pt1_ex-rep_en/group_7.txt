It is in principle possible to apply for restitutio in integrum (Article 122 EPC) for the term for
further processing, since Article 122(5) EPC does not exclude term of Art. 121(2) EPC (see
J 12/92 (unpublished), J ../87 (OJ/1988, 323, points 2.3 and 2.4)). In order for Article 122 EPC

the grounds and J ../87 (OJ EPO 1988, 177, point 4 of the grounds]: The applicant may not invoke the
omission of the communication provided for in Rule 50(1) EPC The time limit for the filing of the
for examination began to run in accordance with Art. 94(2) EPC Since the applicant failed to
pay the examination fee within the time limit the surcharge fell due (Rule 85b EPC).
