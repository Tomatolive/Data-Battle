all States except France and naming French company as applicant for French EP designation
GB filing is the first filing in a Paris Convention state. TW is not a manber of the Paris
Convention Thus, the TW application does not count as an earlier application in the meaning
of Article 8(1) PCI' and Article 4A(1 ) Paris Convention. The client can thus claim priority of ür
GB application under Art. 8(1) PCT. An assignment of the priority right for FR is however
There are no provisions under the PCT for recording licences.
You cannot add these examples to the European application as requested by the client. This
would be an amendment of the applicatiom which would only be taken into account aner receipt
of the search report (Rule 86(1) EPC)_ Any amendment is subject to the requirements of
Art. 123(2) EPC (see also GL, C-VI, 5.7 on the way to deal with the introduction of ülrther
examplß). You camot drop priority ofP1 tNs was tyr first application for the broad
cope ofthe claims and such a broad scope would then only be entitled to the date offiling the
Europan application. Since the European application was filed after the date of publication of
the paper, lack of novelty would result for at least the broad claims.

examiner of the allowability of the claims (GL, C-VI, 5.7a). One could also consider filing an
application for the new examples claiming them in their own right as a selection invention.
The priority term has already expired. Moreover, the application has already been published
(Article 93(1) EPC) and, therefore, its content has become part of the state of the art (Article 54(2)
EPC). Consequently, the filing ofa new application will not result in a valid patent.
Filing an appeal, however, is still possible, since the time limit for filing an appeal has not yet expired
(Article 108 EPC). Nevertheless, in the appeal procedure, the filing of a new set ofclaims directed to
the circuit would not be in view of Rule 86(4) EPC (see also GL C-VI, 5.2(ii)). The
Qßpasive ofan appaL however, allows tir filing of a diviéonal application to the circuit
(Art. see also GL,A-IV, 1.1.3).
Thus, the answer is yes: file an appeal On the earlier application to allow for filing a divisional
application.
