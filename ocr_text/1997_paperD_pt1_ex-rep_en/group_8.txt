The PCT Request Form contains a pre-crossed box for precautionary designations.
The time limit for confirmation of precautionary designations is 15 months from the priority date
(Rule 4.9(b) PCT). In the present case it is on 8 May 1997 (holiday) which is extended to 9 May 1997.
Thus, in the ofCA, PL and W, the confirmation ofprecautionary designations at receiving Offce,
paying designation fees and confirmation fees (50% ofdesignation fees, see Schedule of Fees) can be
carried out until the above time limit
US and KR cannot be designated any longer because they were designated as specific designations.
Specific designations do not fall under precautionary designations (Rule 4.9(b) PCT). The due date for
paying for US and KR with surcharge was 28 March 1997 (holiday) to 1 April 1997. This date
is past. Ifthe PCT application has not yet been published (publication date will normally be around
8 June 197) and ifno other damaging publications have occured, applications for US and KR may still
be possible
