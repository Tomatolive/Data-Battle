When the PCT application was Eiled. MC was a Of the PCT
but not Of the EPC. Therefore, MC could not be designated via a
request for a European patent (PCT Art. 45 (1)
— can designate
via a regional patent only a State -party to both the regional
patent treaty• & the PCT) . This has been confirmed by EPO Legal
Board Of Appeal case law relating to designations Of Denmark in
PCT applications.
Since t here was no valid EP (MC) designation in the PCT appln•
as fi Lea, the EPO cannot ace as a designated office
(Art. 153 (1) EPC refers to EPC contracting states being
designated; case law (see above) makes clear that the states
designated must be in the EPC . Thus, on
nationalization, the EPO cannot act as a designated office for
MC — applicant must national ize direct Iy in MC.
Yes .
The EP application can be fi led in Italian (EPC Art. 14
because the applicant is Ttalian. This allows him
(EPC Rule 6 a 20t (Art. 12 (1) Rules re Fees) reduction in
the fil ing fee payable.
He must then file a translation Of the application into
English, French or German within I month OE the fi ling date,
but no later than 13 rnonths from priority (i.e. 4 June 1993)
( Art. 14 (2) and Rule 6 (1) EPC) . IE the EP appln• is the same as
the Italian one, then the English translat ion al ready supplied
cou Id be used. English then becomes the language Of subsequent
proceedings betore the EPO (EPC Art. 14 (3)) . The translation
into English, French or German must be tiled
the Italian version to obtain the tee reduction (Enlarged Board
Of Appeal case Law) .
ApplicAnt could use his certified copy of the Italian
application as the European application, if the textS are to be
the same for the priori ty and the EP application. The EPO
then accept this as a certified Copy of the priori Ey
application for EPC Rule 38 (3) and Art. 88 and will accept
a declarat ion from the applicant that the English translation
suppl led for the EP appl%• is a direct translation Of the
priori ty appln• (Guidelines) .
The EP applh• must be fi led within 12 months of the Italian
fil ing date (EPC Art. 87 i.e. by 4 May 1993, if priori ty is
to be validly paid.
The exam fee will also be reduced by 20E (EPC Rule 6 (3) and
Art. 12 (1) Rules re Fees) if the exam request is included in
the EP appln• in Italian as well as in an official EPO language.
Again (EBA case law) the Italian exam request must be fi led no
later than simultaneously with the EPO language exam request .
