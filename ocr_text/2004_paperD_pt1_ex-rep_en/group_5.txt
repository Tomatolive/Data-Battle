Question 6:
The designation fees for EPI had to be paid within 6 months of the mention of the publication
of the search report (Alticle 79(2) EPC), i.e. by 02 October 2003
EPI validly designates AT, BE, ES and DE The designation fees were duly paid by the
deadline of 02 October 2003
EP2 was filed within the time limit of Art 79(2) EPC Therefore EP2 may validly designate all
contracting states, including NL (see G4/98), even though EPI did not validly designate NC
EP3 was filed after the time limit of Art 79(2) EPC Thus EP3 may only validly designate those
states which are validly designated in EPI (see G4/98).
The two-month grace period of Rule 85a(2) expired on 2 December 2003
At the time of filing EP3, the Rule 85a(2) time limit had not yet expired. Thus although we are
told that designation fees were only paid for AT, BE, ES and DE for EPI, at the time of filing
EP3, it was still possible to pay further designation fees including the designation fee for NL for
EPI. Thus provided that this/these designation fee(s) was/were paid before 02 December
2003, also NL could have been validly designated in EP3 Othewise only AT, BE and DE may
be validly designated in EP3.
A further consideration concerns the grace period of Rule 85a(1) EPC_ Since the designation
fee for NL was not paid by 2 October 2003, a communication under Rule 85a(1) must be
issued. As long as the grace period triggered by receipt of this communication has not yet
expired, it may still be possible today (24 March 2004) to pay the designation fee for NL in
EPI. If this is still possible, then EP3 can still validly designate NL_ Otherwise, only AT, BE
and DE may be validly designated in EP3_
Question 7:
a) The application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 96(3) EPC)_
To save the application, I would request further processing under Alticle 121 EPC
