Question 7.
With regard to part b) and c), some candidates wrongly proposed to file an appeal
against the communication according to Rule 69 (1) EPC, without requesting an
appealable decision under Rule 69(2)_
Question 8.
In general, the legal situation was correctly understood, but many candidates ignored
the instructions from the client not to pay the extra fees.
Question g.
Most candidates responded following the principal idea to which this question was
directed. However, the provisions in the PCT in part a) were often not correctly and
sufficiently cited.
Question 10.
Again, most candidates responded following the principal idea to which this question
was directed. However, the responses were often not elaborated in sufficient detail. In
particular, the requirement of filing the statement together with the application was often
missed _
Question 11:
Many candidates failed to mention that it is the applicant who has to file the request for
further processing. Most candidates, however, correctly identified that the request
eventually was not validly filed.
