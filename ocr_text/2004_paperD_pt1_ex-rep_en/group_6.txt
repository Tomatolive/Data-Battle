The loss of rights was notified under Rule 69(1) EPC on 01 February 2004 (Rule 78(2) EPC).
Further processing should be requested, the corresponding fee should be paid and the reply
to the communication should be filed within nvo months from notification of the loss of rights,
i.e. until 01 April 2004.
b) The rejection of the further request in communication C2 as such cannot be appealed, as it
does not terminate the proceedings (Article 106(3) and Rule 65 EPC). An appeal would
therefore not be admissible.
c) C3 is a communication under Rule 69(1) EPC
Within two months after notification of C3, I can apply for a decision under Rule 69(2) EPC on
the finding that the application is deemed to be withdrawn.
This decision is appealable (Article 106(1) EPC)_ Thus the finding of loss of rights can be
reviewed by a Board of Appeal
Question 8:
a) Under the given circumstances, since no additional fee is paid, an official protest procedure
is not possible (Rule 40.2(c) PCT).
b) There will be an International Search Report indicating that the search was performed only
for the main invention, i.e. the invention first mentioned in the claims (Article 17(3)(a) PCT and
Rule 47(3) PCT)
The International preliminary examination need not be carried out for the inventions for which
no search was carried out (Rule 66.1 (e) PCT) and the EPO as IPEA will not do so.
Question 9:
a) Rule 64(1)(a) PCT states that, for the purposes of Article 33(2) and (3) PCT, everything
made available to the public by means of written disclosure prior to the relevant date shall be
considered prior art The relevant date is the international filing date (Rule 64(1 )(b)(i) PCT)_
Although Prot A's oral disclosure was before the relevant date, the written version was only
made available to the public later than the relevant date.
According to Rule 64(2) PCT, such a non-written disclosure is not considered part of the prior
art. However, the IPER shall mention such disclosure according to Rule 70.9 PCT.
