b) In the regional phase before the EPO, Prof. A's disclosure will be considered pan of the
prior art since Article 54(2) EPC refers to written or oral description.
Question 10:
The IGA 2003 is an international exhibition as referred to in Article 55(1 )(b) EPC (see e.g.
official list published in OJ 2003)
If the client proceeds as planned, the disclosure of the gardening tool at IGA 2003, would have
to be taken into consideration for the application of Article 54 EPC since it occurred earlier
than six months before the planned filing date of EP-I.
In accordance with G3/98 or G2/99, the relevant date for the calculation of the six-month
period of Article 55(1 ) EPC is the filing date, not the priority date.
Hence EP-I would be lost for lack of novelty over the disclosure at IGA 2003
The six-month period of Alticle 55(1) EPC started on the date of the first disclosure, i.e. on
2409.2003 and thus expires today.
Instead of the national first filing CH-I, the client should therefore file EP-I today and include
on filing the statement under Article 55(2) EPC
Within four months from the filing date of EP-I , i.e. until 2407.2004 extended to 26 07.2004
(Rule 85(1 ) EPC), the certificate referred to in Article 55(2) EPC and the accompanying
documents, which are available to client, must be filed in accordance with Rule 23 EPC_
Question 11:
No, the request for further processing was not validly filed.
The period for filing the request for further processing expired on 14.11.2003 (Article 121(2)
EPC, Rule 78(2) EPC). The request was therefore filed on time.
However, the request for further processing must be filed by the applicant (Article 121 (1)
EPC)_
A transfer shall have effect only when the documents satisfying the EPO that a transfer has
taken place have been produced (Rule 20(3) EPC)_ The declaration of transfer signed by both
companies is satisfactory (GL E-XIII, 1.2) and so the transfer is registered on 27.112003.
