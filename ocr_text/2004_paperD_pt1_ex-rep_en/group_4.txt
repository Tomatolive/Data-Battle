However, exceptions to this are outlined in GI /99_
Question 4:
The EPO transmits the international application to the 1B on the basis of Rule 19. 4 PCT.
When the EPO acts as a receiving office, the PCT-application must be filed in one of the
official languages of the EPO, i.e. English, French or German (Rule 104(1) EPC)_
The international application so transmitted shall be considered to have been received by the 1B
and the International Bureau acts as receiving office according to Rule 19.4 PCT.
The date of receipt is the date on which the EPO received the PCT-application.
The date of receipt of the transmitted application at the 1B is used for the calculation of the due
dates of the transmittal fee, the international fee and the search fee (Rule 19.4 (c) PCT).
Fees have to be paid to the 1B either directly without surcharge or after notification by the 1B
with surcharge
All fees already paid to the EPO will be reimbursed (OJ 1993, p 764).
Question 5:
a)
According to Art 14(2) EPC, a European patent application may be filed in Greek
language for the Greek national.
According to Rule 6 (1) EPC, a translation should have been filed within 3 months after the
filing, but not later than 13 months after the priority date, i.e. at the latest on 13 March
(Saturday), extended to 15 March 2004 (R.85(1) EPC).
Since no translation has been filed, the application is deemed to be withdrawn in accordance
with Article 90(3) EPC_
Since the original application has not yet been published, the application could be
refiled. However, priority can no longer be claimed.
If there are arguments that the "all due care" requirement was met, a request for restitutio in
integrum (Article 122 EPC) is to be filed.
