Possible Solution 01/2004
Question 1
a)
The renewal fee for the third year (Rule 37(3) EPC, first sentence) and the renewal
fee for the fourth year (Rule 37(3) EPC, second sentence) both have to be paid in 2004.
b) According to Rule 37(3) EPC, second sentence, the two renewal fees can be paid
without an additional fee within four months of the filing date of the divisional application, i.e.
until 29 May 2004, extended to 01 June 2004 (Rule 85(1) EPC)_
c)
The renewal fee for the third year can be paid with surcharge until 29 July 2004 in
accordance with Rule 37(3) EPC, third sentence.
The renewal fee for the fourth year can be paid with surcharge within the six-month grace
period of Article 86(2) EPC, which applies ("de ultimo ad ultimo") from the end of one month to
the end of the other, (Rule 37(1) EPC and J4/91). Therefore the renewal fee for the fourth year
can be paid until 31 August 2004
Question 2:
The priority claim of PCTLATE is not valid.
The German utility model is the first application for the invention. A did not claim priority from
the first application (Article 4 C (4) Paris Convention and Article 8(2)(a) PCT)_ Consequently,
PCTLATE has the filing date as the relevant date
The German utility model was made available to the public before the filing date of PCTLATE
and is therefore prior art for PCTLATE
Only the German utility model provides protection for the invention.
Question 3:
In principle, the patent proprietor cannot reinstate the granted claim 1 during the appeal
proceedings.
According to G9/92 or G4/93 (no reformatio in peius), the patent proprietor who did not himself
file an admissible appeal may, in principle, only defend the patent in the form in which it was
maintained by the opposition division in its decision.
