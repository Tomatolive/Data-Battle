Examiners' Report on Paper Dl
The examiners' hope for better structured responses was often disappointed.
Particularly, candidates failed to respond with detailed reasoning in which provisions of
law are applied to the case presented. In detail, the following observations are made:
Question 1
Most candidates found the solution for pan a) according to which the renewal fees had
to be paid for the 3rd and 4th year. This is also true for the time limit asked for in part b).
Most candidates, however, failed to correctly respond to part c) in that they did not
distinguish the differing time limits for paying the renewal fees for the 3rd and 4th years
with surcharge.
Question 2.
Surprisingly many candidates failed to identify that the priority of PCTLATE is not valid.
A good portion of those candidates who correctly identified the priority problem referred
to the EPC provisions instead of the provisions of the Paris Convention and the PCT.
Very few candidates considered that valuable protection in Germany is anyway given by
the utility model.
Question 3.
The majority of candidates correctly responded to this questiom Most candidates,
however, missed to mention the exceptions to the general rule of no reformatio in peius
outlined in GI /99_
Question 4:
Even though a majority of candidates answered that the International Bureau will act as
Receiving Office in this case, most candidates failed to explain to whom and until when
the various fees had to be paid.
Questions 5.
This question was generally well answered, even if only few candidates proposed the
simple option to refile the applicatiom
Question 6.
Most candidates failed to mention that, for EP3, there would have been a possibility to
designate. Other than that, the question was generally well answered.
