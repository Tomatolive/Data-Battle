In Part II, few took the important point that Grisk had no right to claim DKI
priority, as he was not the applicant in that appl ication. Similarly, many
proposed to include GrLsk's inventions in EP2 with Smart as sole appl icant,
claiming EP3 priority Without assignment Of Grisk's right to priority.
To keep EP3 in force, some failed to realise that a translation into English,
French or German is needed. Most appreciated that fees vere due, although the
time periods involved were often calculated inaccurately.
Few knew that, with Grisk co-operative, there vas no need to keep EP3 in force ,
provided that it was sufficient to establish a valid priority date, e.g. for a
PCT application.
Many vho recommended claiming priority from DKI and EP3 did not realise that EP3
contained some Grisk inventions not belonging to Smart and that Grisk was the
applicant in EP 3, so both should be applicants in the PCT application.
Candidates seemed unfamiliar with second medical indication claims and many
showed an inability to use the "optimal" claims from DKI as the basis for the
claims to be filed Vith PCT2, Whether as such or in combination with EP3.
The greater difficulties arising When Grisk was unco-operative were realised by
many, but few proposed effective action. Most recommended entitlement proceedings
in Denmark, followed by a request for suspension In the EPO. Few noted that
suspension was only effective after publication and that fees and a translation
were needed to ensure such publication.
Whilst fees are payable by anyone, filing a translation is a procedural step not
available to Smart. Many did not realise that the entitlement would not be for
the whole Of EP3, but only for the parts owned by Smart.
In assessing Whether or not to keep EP3 alive, credit was given for Intelligent
argument in support Of the choice made, whether or not Grisk was co-operative.
Thus, it could be argued that EP3 should be allowed to go by default, checking
after the final dates for translation and fees, and including Smart's inventions
(not Grisk's) in an early PCT (or EP or Danish) application without Grisk's
help, relying upon Article 55 (or its equivalent) to deal with disclosure to
Albatross. One problem With this would be the possibility of Grisk (or Albatross)
filing another application claiming priority from EP3, Which could render its
contents prior art under Article 54(3) EPC.
The recent Enlarged Board Of Appeal 's Decision G 3/92 was not available before
the examination, so that some argued that maintenance Of EP3 was important to
have a pending application to be the subject of Article 61(1) proceedings, and
discussed the various options open.
The difficulty of including inventions not made by Smart alone in any proposed
PCT appl ication vas overlooked by many candidates who recommended the inclusion
of the contents of EP3 in such PCT cases. Whilst it is conceivable, the likeli-
hood of the Danish Court acting quickly enough to give a decision, even Interim,
in time to allow a PCT application to be filed before 3 June 1994 (the date to
claim DKI priority) seems to be too small to justify claiming EP3 priority and
including its contents without some explanation Of what to do if no early
decision were to be obtained.
Comparison of the PCT and EP routes was generally poor, although some noted the
accelerated prosecution advantage of any EP application. Against this, several
noted the ready and quick access to Japan and the USA via PCT. The acceptability
of English language appl [cations in Japan was not then available.
