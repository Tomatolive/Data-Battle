Process A (S)
Process B (S)
process C (G)
process for the separation Of X and Z from mixture Y (G)
If Smart and Grisk agree that they are likely to cover working
inventions, the following claims would be added:
Use of product Z for the production of an anti -viral agent (S & G)
Use of product Z for the production of an anti-herpes virus agent
Use of product Z for the production of an anti-measles and anti -chicken
pox virus agent (S & G)
(Although optimal for protection, as stated in Che Note to candidates
on page 2, method of treatment claims could be added, as being
allowable in U.S.A.).
I) Because Grisk has refused to co-operate, it has to be assumed that he may
continue with EP3 or an application based thereon. As Smart owns and
invented some parts Of this, the first legal Step to be taken is to take
advantage of Art. 5 of the protocol on Recognition and apply to the
Hari time and Commercial Court in Copenhagen for a declaration of ownership
of those parts of EP3 which comprise the contents of DKI and which
disclose and claim process B. If possible, an injunction should be sought
requiring Grisk to take all necessary steps to maintain EP3 in force until
a final decision is obtained. This is because. although Smart can pay the
fees (Legal Advice 6/1991), only Grisk or Mullet can carry out procedural
steps, such as filing a translation, withdrawing the application or
priority claim. Immediately folloving the instigation of entitlement
proceedings in Copenhagen, suspension Of the patent application
proceedings should be requested In accordance Vith Rule 13 EPC so that
Crisk cannot wilfully withdrawn the application EP3 (Rule 14 EPC). Such
proceedings cannot, however, be stayed until publication Which is to be
expected in December 1994 (last sentence Of Rule 13(1) EPC)
B Li) yes.
If ownership of those portions of EP3 which disclose and claim process B
and which disclose the contents of DKI is adjudged to be that of Smart
quickly, then under Art. 61(1) EPC, Smart may choose between prosecuting
the application EP3 as his own application, filing a nev application, and
asking for the application to be refused. As ownership vill only be of
part Of EP3, the second course Of action is probably to be expected Vith
consequential amendment Of EP3, although the first course could be
folloved alloving Grisk to file a divisional application. Then PCT2 could
be filed as planned but claiming also priority from EP3, that is before
03.06.94
If a final decision is not obtained until after this date, then Smart must
continue Vith DKI and its derivatives, and EP3 separately and hope to
obtain a decision in good time to be able to file corresponding
applications before 01 . 02 . 95.
