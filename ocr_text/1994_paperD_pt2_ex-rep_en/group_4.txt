identity Of the applicant, and (d) a description and at least one claim in
one Of the languages permitted under Art. 14(1) and 14(2) EPC. If Grisk
and Mullet used a standard form Of request When filing EP3. which mast be
checked, all these requirements were satisfied and EP3 has a Valid filing
date of 01.02.94. EP3 need not be kept alive so long as it is used as the
basis for priority claims in later patent applications.
Ail i) Yes; upon the assumption that Smart and Grisk are happy to have patent
applications in which they are joint applicants and that each vill ovn his
own inventions, leaving a sorting out until prosecution results in the
possible need and opportunity to file divisional appl {cations. This is
because there are inventions not disclosed or covered in DKI and EP3 and
because protection is wanted outside EP countries.
a) Although a PCT application should be filed, it would not be exactly as
planned for PCT2, but would include the related inventions Of
Smart, Grigk and the joint inventions of Smart and Grisk. This vill be
referred to ag PCTtâ€¢. Because it include inventions not previously
disclosed in patent applications, it be filed as Soon as possible
and claim priority from both patent appl ications including relevant
inventions, i.e. DKI and EP3. As Smart has planned to designate all PCT
Contracting States, i.e. Including USA and Europe, this would be done.
b) PCT4 should name Smart and Grisk as joint applicants joint
inventors, because PCT4 vill include claims (see d) whose ovners are
indicated, because priority from DKI and EP3 is to be
because inventorship is important in USA.
e) As noted under a) above, PCT4 should be filed as soon as possible and
before 03.06, 94 With a claim to priority from DKI (03.06.93) and EP3
(01.02.94). As both vere filed in Danish, it be quickest to use the
Danish I anguage When filing.
d) should have the following claims :
Product X (S)
Product Y, mixture of X and Z (G)
Product Z in the form suitable for administration to
