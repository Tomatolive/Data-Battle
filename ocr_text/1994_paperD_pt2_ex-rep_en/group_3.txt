For both situations, it is to be noted that Grisk cannot claim the priority of
DKI for EP3, because Smart is named as applicant in DKI and he alone has the
right under Art. 87(1) EPC.
A i) If it is desired to keep EP3 in force, the following steps should be
taken :
l) The filing and search fees should be paid. These fees vere due,
pursuant to Art. 78(2) EPC, within one month of filing, i.e. 01.03.94.
They can still be paid, pursuant to Rule 85a(1) EPC within one month of
notification by the EPO. Mullet or Grisk should be asked if and when
such notification has been received, as it is likely that the one month
has not expired. Because EP3 vas filed in Danish, EP3 is entitled to a
reduction of the filing fee (Rule 6(3) EPC, Art. 12 Rules relating
to Fees). The fees mist be paid Vith a surcharge of (Arc. 2 No. 3b
Rules relating to Fees).
2) The designation fees should be paid. These fees are not due until
twelve months after the date of priority (Art. 79(2) EPC), that is
03.06.94, the anniversary of the filing of DKI.
3) A translation of the Danish language documents into an official
language of the EPO (EN, FR. or DE) pursuant to Art. 14(2) EPC must be
filed at t:he EPO within three months of the filing date (Rule 6<1)
EPC). As the filing date was 01.02 . 94, the three months end on
01.05 . 94, which is no later than thirteen months after the date of
priority (03.06.93). Because 01.05.94 is a Sunday, the deadline date
for filing the translation is 02 .05.94 under Rule 85(1) EPC.
The translation must be filed and the fees paid before the expiry of the stated
deadlines. If the grace period for paying the filing and search fees has expired
and the application is deemed to have been withdrawn under Art. 90(3) EPC, but
further processing is possible under Art. 121 EPC, provided that the fees and
surcharge are paid within the time 1 Lmit. The provisions of Art. 122 EPC are not
available in view of Art. 122(5) EPC.
As Grisk was not entitled to claim priority from DKI, it would be advisable to
abandon the priority claim at once. This would eliminate the need to provide a
certified copy Of DKI and a translation thereof. As you vere inventor Of DKI and
the joint inventor Of process B. the designation Of inventor should be
corrected. With the consent Of Grisk, Smart should be added as co-applicant.
A IL) Probably not.
Arguments in favour of maintaining EP3 would be that it has been disclosed
to Albatross (although this may have been in confidence); that there is
the possibility that a third party may be working in the field and seeking
to obtain patents for the same invention; and that it is the first patent
application With disclosure Of Grisk's inventions and Grisk and Smart'S
joint inventions. Thus, it ig important to establish the ing date as
the priority date for further applications in Europe and elsevhere .
Provided EP3 has a valid filing date, this priority can be claimed under
Art. Of the Paris Convention and Art. 87 (2) and 87 (3) EPC,
whatever happens to Ep3. The minimum requirements for establishing a
filing date for EP3 under Art. 80 EPC are: (a) an indication that a patent
is sought, (b) the designation Of at least one Contracting State, (c) the
