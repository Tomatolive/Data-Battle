If it is not possible to keep EP3 in force because an injunction is not
issued in time and, for example, the translation is not filed, then the
subject matter Of EP3 belonging to Smart can be claimed in PCT2 as
planned. The disclosure to Albatross, if it Vas not confidential, is a
non-prejudicial disclosure under Art. 55 EPC, because Grisk vas bound by
agreement not to disclose.
Bili) It is reconnended to file PCT2 as planned as soon as possible, claiming
priority from DKI, and before 03 .06.94.
EP3 filed by Grisk has the earliest priority date for the invention Of
process B and could be cited against a later EP application by Smart under
Art. 54(3), if Smart is unable to claim priority Of EP3. Hovever, Art. 55
provides some protection for Smart if he is unable to get a favourable
decision from the Copenhagen Court in time. If a favourable decision is
Obtained in time, then priority from EP3 should be claimed.
Smart would be the sole applicant, because Grisk refuses to co-operate,
but Grisk should sign the application form because he is a joint inventor
With Smart and thus needs to be a joint appl icant for USA. If he refuses
to do this, evidence Will be needed Of his non-co-operation to overcome
the lack of signature (Rule 4.15(b) PCT). Grisk could be required to sign
by a Court injunction, if this can be obtained in time.
B iV) The advantage Of filing a European patent application (EP5) in place of
PCT2 is that Grisk's signature is not required to request a European
patent, nor for any other documents filed at the EPO. Accordingly, Grisk's
nan-co-operation is unimportant as far as the EP application is concerned.
Grisk must be named as inventor for any invention Of which he is the true
inventor or joint Inventor. Another advantage of the EP route is that
Smart may request accelerated prosecution of hig application to obtain
early grant of an EP patent.
The main disadvantages Of using the European route directly are that the
EP fees must be paid up at once, and that further applications must be
filed if protection is to be obtained in USA and elsewhere.
The PCT route gives Smart more time to evaluate the inventions before the
major cost time Of the EP regional phase. If Smart requires rapid grant,
Chapter II may be used in combination Vith a request for accelerated
prosecuti on.
a) EP5 should name Smart as sole applicant. PCT2 should Smart as sole
appl {cant for all designated States except USA. For USA, Smart and
Grisk must be named as joint applicants because they are joint
inventors.
b) Priority from DKI should be claimed Vith filing of PCT2 or EP5 before
03 Priority from EP3 should also be claimed, if the Danish Court
has decided in time to assign the part Of EP3 disclosing process B to
Smart.
c) PCT2 or EP5 should Include all those claims listed under Aiii(d) above
which are owned by Smart alone. The description should include all the
matter owned solely by Smart, taking great care that none of Grisk's
information is included.
