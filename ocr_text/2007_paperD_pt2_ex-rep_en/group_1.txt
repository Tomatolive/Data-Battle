Examiners' Report Paper D 2007 Part II
This year about half of the marks awarded related to an analysis of Caledonian's [and their
subsidiary Sean Insulation] patent poltfolio and making appropriate recommendations
bearing in mind the constraints imposed by Caledonian The remaining marks were
awarded to analysis of the situation relating to Goldfinger and Ms. Moneypenny. Generally
the candidates answered the first part reasonably well and the second part not so well.
Crucial issues in the paper were.
the invalidity of the priority claim for EP2
whether the date shown on a document is actually the date of public availability
ensuring that the client continues to have rights to composition B+A after disposal of
Sean Insulation
and
sufficiency of disclosure of EP-Gold and UK-Penny
Candidates did not need to get all of these points to pass, although those who got fewer
than two of these points were unlikely to pass.
In more detail:
The candidates were expected first to analyse the situation, including priority claims and
ownership of the different patent rights, then to provide advice to obtain the best protection
possible for the client Many candidates were able to analyse the situation correctly, but
only some of them were also able to formulate useful and complete advice to solve the
conflicts with the competitor
In their analysis, some candidates failed to notice that there were prior art publications that
could cause problems if priorities were lost. Some others failed to notice the invalidity of
the priority claim of EP2. Some others failed to comment on the effects of the various co-
pending applications upon each other. Some others simply did not doubt that the date
shown on AJSS was actually the date of its public availability, although there was clearly
no guarantee in this respect
Most candidates determined that new application(s) were to be filed, but not all of them
clearly indicated who should have been the applicant(s) for these applications, what
content and what priority claims the application(s) should have had.
Not many candidates gave advice that actually took into account the intention to sell
company Sean Insulation.
Many candidates showed difficulties in spotting the weak aspects of the patent position of
competitor Goldfinger thoroughly, particularly the insufficient disclosure of EP-Gold Some
of those candidates gave advice elaborating on entitlement proceedings, although the
client explicitly excluded to follow that way; some others simply concluded that a cross
licence might be a solution, without considering other much more favourable options.
The opportunities offered by the patent application filed by the former employee, Ms.
Moneypenny, were properly considered by most candidates
Quite surprisingly, some candidates didn't realize that any patent validly claiming ALFA
would have blocked the exploitation of BETA as well.
