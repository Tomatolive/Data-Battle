New applications must be filed before the end of the priority year of EP-I (18.0307,
Sunday, postponed to 19.0307) and preferably before publication of IJK-I , EP-2 and
Sean-PCT, that will be on or after 16.039007 to limit their relevance as prior art to novelty
only.
If Sean-PCT enters national and regional phases and is granted, Sean Insulation will have
rights to the composition B+A and to any type of product comprising composition B+A_
This might hinder your business later Therefore it is essential to ensure that rights for B+A
compositions are transferred to Caledonian before selling Sean Insulation. You can buy or
transfer Sean-PCT and IJK-I from Sean Insulation to Caledonian or obtain a license for
B+A for Caledonian or arrange for joint ownership with exploitation agreement Keep rigid
panels only in the name of Sean Insulation by later filing divisional applications for
example.
Question 3
EP-Gold has the first filing date for weaving process ALFA. EP-Gold claims also woven
fabric, but woven fabric is disclosed and claimed by EP-3 and by PCT application(s) to be
filed claiming priority from EP-3 as suggested above. These applications would be prior art
relevant only for novelty and for commonly designated states against EP-Gold (Art. 54(3)
(4) EPC) when they enter the EP regional phase
EP-Gold, on the other hand, could be prior art relevant only for novelty (under 54(3) (4)
EPC) against any application claiming priority from UK-Penny, only for commonly
designated states and only if Goldfinger pays designation fees
EP-Gold, however, does not disclose how to make fibres and yarns from composition B+A
(extrusion process) and the claimed weaving process ALFA can only work with those
fibres and yarns. This extrusion process was neither common knowledge, nor publicly
disclosed at the date of filing of EP-Gold. As a result, EP-Gold suffers from a lack of
sufficient disclosure since the starting material for the weaving process ALFA was not
available. This claim of EP-Gold seems to be not patentable.
In addition to that, since EP-Gold is not an enabling disclosure, it cannot be part of the
state of the art and novelty destroying to a clam for process ALFA based on the disclosure
of I-JK-Penny.
Fulthermore, if EP-Gold is in breach of the secrecy agreement between Ms Moneypenny
and Goldfinger, its publication would be an abusive publication and it cannot be
considered as prior art against any claim to process ALFA based on the disclosure of UK-
Penny.
UK-Penny has the first filing date for weaving process BETA. UK-Penny has enabling
disclosure for:
process BETA because any fibres can be used (thanks to feature Y);
process ALFA because it refers to press release and the extrusion process for the
necessary starting material (yarns) had become publicly available.
In the absence of prior art against process ALFA, corresponding claims of EP-GoId are
likely to be granted if no action is taken.
