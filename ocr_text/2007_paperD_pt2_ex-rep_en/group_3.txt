UK-I is in the name of Sean Insulation. If Sean Insulation decides to continue with it, then
IJK-I will be a national prior right for EP-2 and EP-3 if/when they are granted and
validated in UK UK-I has the earliest filing date (or Sean-PCT has earliest priority date)
for composition B+A and for insulating foamed sheets from B+A_
Sean-PCT has the same description and claims as UK-I and validly claims priority of UK-
1. Once it enters the European phase, it will be prior an relevant for novelty only (under
54(3) EPC) against EP-2 and EP-3 for commonly designated states UK-I and Sean-PCT
disclose composition B+A, which would destroy the novelty of any unamended claim
directed to compositions B+Z
Question 2
Actions to be taken:
Check when AJSS was made available to the public in order to determine whether it is
relevant prior art against EP-2 and EP-3 or not
EP-I is the only application which definitely has a filing date prior to the publication of
AJSS_ By claiming priority from EP-I anticipation by AJSS could be avoided.
Fulthermore, protection for thin sheets of B alone is requested since they have become
commercially interesting and this feature is disclosed in EP-I but is missing from any other
application.
Thus,
- file a PCT application claming priority of EP-I, EP-2 and EP-3 (multiple priorities are
allowable) or more than one with suitable priorities;
- disclose and claim all features claimed in EP-I, EP-2 and EP-3 and add extra claims to.
- sheets made of foamed B alone as per EP-I ;
- scuba diving suits and costumes made of woven textiles;
- compositions B+ class Z, except B+A;
- compositions B+C/D/E and thin foamed sheets made thereof;
- scuba diving suits and costumes made of foamed B+A;
- use of non-woven textiles as liners for insulation panels and lined panels, for future
transfer to Sean Insulation.
Preferably, file a first PCT application, claiming priority from EP-I , EP-2 and EP-3,
claiming only what should be assigned to Sean Insulation and a second PCT application,
claiming also priority from EP-I, EP-2, EP-3 with claims directed to all that Caledonian
wants to keep. Alternatively, file one PCT application and later, during national/regonal
phases file divisionals to assign to Sean Insulation the subject matter interesting to them.
You can withdraw EPO and EP-3 or abandon them by not paying examination and
designation fees in order to save costs. Continue with PCT application(s) only and request
partial refund of search fee(s) for PCT application(s) on the basis of EP-2 and/or EP-3
