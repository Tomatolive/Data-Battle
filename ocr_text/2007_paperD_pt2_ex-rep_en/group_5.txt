Question 4
Weaving process BETA is based on process ALFA plus additional feature Y and is,
therefore, within the scope of EP-Gold_
EP-Gold could be used by Goldfinger to threaten customers and may be asserted in those
designated states permitting patent infringement action based on an application.
If EP-Gold is granted, Goldfinger would have a patent to process ALFA for designated
states where the patent will be validated and which could be asserted against use of
process ALFA as well as BETA in those states. The products directly produced by these
processes would also fall under the scope of EP-Gold and Goldfinger would have the
rights to them as well.
Since EP-Gold was filed less than one year ago, it can still be basis for filing applications
in other countries or jurisdictions
Question 5
Reach an agreement with Ms Moneypenny and file an EP or PCT application claiming
priority of UK-Penny as soon as possible. If Caledonian is sole applicant priority rights
have to be assigned before filing; othennise file jointly with Ms. Moneypenny_ Alternatively,
Ms Moneypenny can be the sole applicant and assign the application (in whole or in pan)
to Caledonian subsequently. UK-Penny has full disclosure of weaving process ALFA and
BETA but only BETA is claimed, so, in the application to be filed, claim also process ALFA,
I.e. process without additional feature Y
Caledonian will have a patent to fibres, yarns and woven fabric made of polymer
composition B+Z in all states from the PCT application(s) claiming priority of EP-3.
PCT application(s) deriving from EP-3 will be prior art against EP-Gold relevant only for
novelty (Art. 54(3)(4) EPC) when European phase is entered so at that time all countries
should be designated and fees paid to ensure that no protection can be obtained by
Goldfinger for woven fabric
If EP-Gold and its search report have been published (earlier publication), file third party
observations with a copy of the PCT application(s) claiming priority of EP-3 and EP-3 itself.
EP-Gold is also invalid because of insufficient disclosure, so you can add this remark
when filing observations or you can file an opposition if/when it is granted.
Monitor whether EP-Gold has family members in other countries.
In any case, because the weaving process ALFA in EP-Gold is dedicated to weaving yams
of polymer composition B+A only, it cannot be used without consent of Caledonian/Sean
Insulation that have a right to woven polymer fabrics.
So, write to Goldfinger pointing out all the above remarks on the patentability and
insufficiency of EP-Gold and demand they withdraw it before publicatiom
All the above is based on European Law, if Goldfinger is in a better position in other
jurisdictions, a cross licensing agreement may be necessary
