Possible Solution
Question 1
- Paper D 2007 - Part II
EP-I is in the name of Caledonian and has earliest filing date for the new foaming
process, for flexible thin sheets made from B+A, for foamed sheets of B alone and for
scuba suits and costumes made from B+A or from B alone. EP-I is deemed withdrawn
because no fee was paid and it cannot be revived. However, since it received a filing date,
priority from EP-I can still be claimed.
EP-2 is the first filing for compositions B+C, B+D and B+E and thin flexible foamed sheets
of these compositions and scuba costumes/suits made of these sheets. There may be
basis in EP-2 to claim a more general polymer composition of B+ class Z EP-2 claims
priority of IJK-I but this claim is not valid because EP-2 is in the name of Caledonian and
IJK-I is in the name of Sean Insulation. Therefore, the effective date for EP-2 is 19.0606
(the filing date).
The article in AJSS is dated 16.06_06 but may have been made available to the public
earlier or later If AJSS was available to the public before 19.0606 (filing date of EP-2) it
will be full prior art against EP-2_ It will thus destroy the novelty of B+A, B+C, B+D and
possibly of thin sheets in general. Since polymer E belongs to the same polymer class with
B, C, and D (class Z) and is similar to them, the combination B+E will most probably be not
inventive over AJSS either Under these circumstances, no protection can be obtained for
compositions B+C/D/E_ However, if AJSS was made available to the public on, or after
1906.06 it will not be prior art against EP-2_
The new process for producing thin sheets of EPO is not disclosed in AJSS and is
therefore not anticipated in any event
EP-3 is the first filing for the manufacturing process for fibers and yarns and for the textiles
made thereof. EP-3 claims polymer compositions B+class Z, but EP-2, which discloses
compositions of B+A/C/D/E will be prior art relevant only for novelty (under Art. 54(3) (4)
EPC) against the clams to B+ class Z of EP-3_
AJSS discloses B+A/C/D and, because of the difference in dates benveen that shown on
AJSS and the filing date of EP-3, is almost certainly prior art against EP-3
US-Spectre does not disclose any combination of polymers and is not relevant against any
application.
The press release was made in August 2006 which is later than any effective date of the
three applications. It is thus irrelevant in respect to them.
Thin sheets of foamed polymer B alone and suits made of these sheets were disclosed in
EP-I, but are not disclosed or claimed by any of the presently pending applications. Thin
sheets of B alone and suits made thereof are suggested in AJSS_
