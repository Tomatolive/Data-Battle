In accordance with Rule 78 (3) EPC notifications are deemed to
be delivered on the tenth date following its posting. Thus
corrununication deemed to have been made on 3 February 1990.
Time limits expressed in months are calculated to expire in
relevant month on same number day - Rule 83 (4) EPC, trom
relevant notification.
Thus
3 February 1990 + 4 months =
3 June 1990.
This is a Sunday and thug offices are closed and in accordance
with Rule 85 (1) EPC time limit is extended to next day on
which Offices are Open. 4 June 1990 is a Bank Holiday and thus
time limit is extended to Tuesday 5 June 1990.
Under Rule 51 (4) the period set may be extended by a maximum
of two months providing representative applies for extension
before expiry of time limit. No grounds for extension are
required. The two month extension would expire on 5 August
1990 which again a Sunday So under Rule 85 (1) would expire
on Monday 6 August 1990.
Only one extension is al Iowable and if applicant fails to
respond within extended period application is refused in
accordance with Rule 51 (5) EPC and he would be notified of
this Rule 69 (1) - Art. 119. The applicant could then apply for
further processing under provisions Of Art. 121 within two
months OE notification.
Art. (I) States that application must contain a request,
description, claim (s) , and abstract but in accordance with
Art. 80 a date Of fi ling can be granted if there is an
indication that EPA is sought, designaeion Of at least one
state, information identifying applicant (all of which have
been provided by the request for grant) and a descript ion and
one or more claims
Thug, assuming British application was
fi led with at least one claim, it could be argued that
priori ey document fui fils this requirement. Thus file extra
copies Of application etc. to comply with EPC in arder to
maintain priori ty and European application having same scope
as initial application as rectification of deficiencies in the
application documents provided for by Rule 41 (1) .
In the alternative, an attempt could be made to claim a
correction of error in document in accordance with Rule 88
EPC. However, in this case no document real Iy corresponding to
description and claims other than priori ty document was fi led
â€” thus arguably no document to correct. Also corrections to
description and claims must be obvious (last sentence Rule 88)
and although case law has held priori ty document may be used
to support Such requests it is un1ike1y that complete
replacement of text would be allowable. Better to request that
priori ey document be considered to represent the
description/ claims and fil ing of extra copies etc. merely
represents a correction of deficiencies as allowed for under
Rule 41 (1) EPC.
