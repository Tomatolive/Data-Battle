Under Art. 114 (1) the EPO is entitled to examine the faces of
a case Of its own motion i.e. does not need to be directed by
an opponent. However conflicting case law exists on this point
and the most recent decision by the Technical Board Of Appeal
held that it was not for the opposition division to
effectively reopen examination proceedings of its own motion
during opposition but was to rely on facts raised dur ing the
proceedings. Nevertheless, where there is Very clearly a valid
ground Of opposition to a granted patent it is reasonable for
the EPO to safeguard the public against invalid patents being
maintained. Thus opposition division will advise proprietor
that ground for opposition under Art. 100 (c) exists in respect
of claim and unless proprietor amends patent to delete claim
as provided for in Art. 102 (3) the Opposition Division will
revoke the patent in accordance with Art. 102 (1) .
7 (a) Time limit set under Rule 51 (6) iS non—extendable (line 6) but
is set by the EPO to be "not Iess than two months or more than
three months• . In accordance with Rule 51 (8) if tees are not
paid in due time the application iS deemed to be withdrawn and
applicane would be notified of withdrawal in accordance with
Art. 119 EPC and Rule 69(1) .
7 (b) Art. 121 (1) provides remedy this failure since application
is deemed to be withdrawn following failure to reply within
time limit set be office. Thus applicant must request further
processing and pay the grant and printing tees, thus
complet ing omitted act Art. 121 (2) .
7 (c) Wi thin months of notification Of the corrtnunication that
8.
application is deemed to be withdrawn.
Alternatively, if failure to pay was due to some particular
reason and was "in spite Of all due care•
— then • Restitutio
in integrum* under Art. 122 may be applied for. This
application must be fi led in writing within two months Of
removal Of cause of non—compliance and within a year of expiry
Of the time limit Art. 122 (2) . Pull grounds and facts must be
set out and grant and printing fees paid within two month
peri od.
Interruption Of proceedings under Rule 90 EPC applies only to
the applicant for or proprietor of a European pat ent or his
representative, and does not appear to apply to an opponent ,
who is nevertheless a party to the proceedings .
However, in the Ci rCumStanceS it seems likely that an
request fi led with the EPO to defer the oral
proceedings would be granted and a situation analogous to
Rule 90 interruption would exist and the EPO would re—set the
date for oral proceedings to take place. However, costs
incurred in the cancellation e.g. Of interpreters etc. rnay be
incurred in accordance with Rule 63 EPC.
In the alternative proceedings would continue even in the
absence of any further contribution from the "Opponent" and a
decision would be reached by Opposition Division on basis of
faces and arguments al ready submitted.
