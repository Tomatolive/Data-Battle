Can farther processing within time limit Must pay fee within time limit (Art 121 (2)
EPC) and complete Omitted act (Art 121 (2) EPC), ie file response to examination report
On 13 Nov 96, time limit has expired, So option (a) is not available. Could try for
under Art 122 (possible in principle according to J12/92). This requires showing that the
applicant took "all due care" to meet the time limit missed (in this case, the time limit for filrther
processing). It is unlikely that we can show this, given that the applicant Sent instructions so
close to the due date (sæ for instance and had deliberately chosen to abandon the case
Ifwe try this, to do within 2 mths of removal of cause of non-compliance (in this case,
probably my receipt of information that applicant has changed his mind, see for instance J 7/82)
and I yr from missed time limit (due date for further processing - I Nov 96), both under

Also, renewal fees may have fallen due - need to pay these if still within period for doing so.
According to Rule 500 ) EPC, the EPO informs the applicant ofthe date of mention of publication

The EPO will not refund the surcharge.
For tlr countries specifically designated (KR and US), the fees can be paid with surcharge (R 16bis.
2 PCT) within one month of the EPO communication, by R16bis. 1 PCT The surcharge is 500/0 of
designation fees to be paid (but is not less than the transmittal fee [RI 6bis. or more than
the basic fee, R16bis. 2(b)). This is all due by I Apr 97. Under R80.6(a) PCT time limits begin on
date of mailing. Under R80.2 PCT time limit ends on 28 Mar 97. Under R80.5 PCT it is extended
to next EPO working day, i.e. 1 Apr 97. On 4 Apr 97 we are too late
For those not specifically designated, ie CA, PL and RU, the precautionary designation system can
be used. All were members of the PCT on the date of filing The standard PCT Request form
PCT/RO/IOI contains a declaration under R4 that all states party to the PCT are designated
subject to confirmation. Confirmation is due 15 mth from priority, ie by 8 May 97.
Und« R4 precautionary dßignations do apply to specifically designated countries, so we
cannot apply this procedure to KR and US. Could perhaps try asking for some sort ofrestitution in
those countries under Rule 82bis PCT
