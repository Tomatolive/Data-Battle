Yes.
To file a PCT applicatiom only one applicant needs to be national or resident of a PCT
contracting State (RI 8.3 PCT). The Taiwanese inventor is not entitled (Taiwan is not a PCT
memtM state), but the French company is (France is a PCT member state).
By Section 203 (a) PCT Administrative Instructions, different applicants may be named for
different designated states
However, it is not possible to designate FR as a national application but only as a Euro-PCT
designation, under Art 45(2) PCT
The EPC allows, under Art 59 EPC, different applicants to designate different contracting
states. The FR company can be applicant for EP(FR) and the Taiwanese inventor for all other
EP states.
PCT priority is determined under the Paris Convention, Art 8(1) and (2) PCT.
Under Paris Convention Art 1 ) and (4), the first application in a Paris Convention country
is the relevant one for priority. The Taiwanese application was not in a Paris Convention
country (TW is not a member) the GB application is the relevant first application and priority
can validly be claimed.
Howeva, sonr countries (g DE, BE) do not recognise priority rights for applications filed by
applicants not resident or national Ofa Paris Convention Country, but the EPO does. TtMe is
a risk that the eventual national patents in sorne countries will be held to be not to
priority by the national coulT
We are within tlr priority year urxier Art 4C(l), can claim from 1 May 1996 application.
TIE PCT contains no provisions regstration of licenc«. This must be done with the national
or regiornl offces on entry to the national or regional phase, if possible with those offces.
It will not be possible to add the examples to the application, because this would contravene
Art 123(2) EPC, as confirmed by Guidelines C-VI, 5.7.
Dropping the priority Pl is anyway not advisable This would mean paper reproducing contents
Of P1 would become prior art under Art 54(2) and would destroy novelty Of the claims.
I can howev« qabmit tir example to the EPO during examination. I shall do this after receipt
Of the Search Report and before examination begins, asking that they be taken into account
This is usually permitted, see Guidelines C-VI, 5.7a, in particular since the examples support
an advantage (effect already discussed in the application)
