nonetheless assumed that the identification of the document within the opposition period
was implied by its use as a basis for the ground of opposition. These candidates answered
as if the opposition was admissible. As a result, candidates inappropriately applied the
provisions of Article 114 EPC and concluded that the late filed document would be taken
into account
Some candidates did not realise that the opposition division can not exercise its discretion
under Article 114(1 ) EPC if the opposition is rejected as inadmissible.
Question 5
Many candidates correctly answered those parts of the question relating to representation
in the international phase. Where mistakes were made these related to not recognising
that Mr Surat will be the common representative irrespective of whether he is mentioned
first, and not recognising that an Indian agent is entitled to represent the applicant before
the EPO acting as IPEA.
Moreover, few candidates recognised that because Mr Surat has to appoint a professional
representative, Mr Wilson cannot represent both applicants in the European phase.
Question 6
This question was generally not well answered.
Candidates picked up some marks by calculating the time limit for paying the additional
search fee and the time limit for replenishing the debit account Very few candidates
realised that a debit order for the administrative fee also has to be sent.
