If the applicants do not appoint a common representative, the applicant first named in the
request who is entitled to file an International application with the receiving Office shall be
considered to be the common representative of all the applicants, Rule PCT. Since
Mr Surat is the only applicant entitled to file an International application at the Patent Office
of India, he will be the common representative.
bl) In accordance with Article 49 PCT or Rule 90.1 (a) PCT, a person having the right to
practice before the national Office with which the International application is filed may
be appointed by the applicant to represent him before the International Preliminary
Examining Authority. Thus an Indian agent may be appointed.
b2) According to Rule I(c) PCT, a person having the right to practice before the EPO
c)
acting as the International Preliminary Examining Authority may be appointed by the
applicant to represent him before that Authority. Thus a European professional
representative may be appointed.
Since Mr Surat does not have his residence in a Contracting State of the EPC, he
has to be represented by a professional representative, Article 133(2) EPC Thus, Mr
Surat is obliged to appoint a professional representative and this representative shall
be deemed to be the common representative, Rule 151(1) EPC Thus, Mr Wilson, an
employee of company A, cannot be appointed as common representative.
Answer to question 6
If, within a period of one month of receipt of the fax, i.e. before 25 February 2013, the
account is sufficiently replenished to enable payment of the second search fee, and within
the same period an administrative fee is paid, then the date on which the debit order was
received shall be considered to be the date on which payment was made, see
Arrangement for deposit accounts (ADA) 6.5. According to Alticle ) No. 2 Rules relating
to Fees or the Agreement between the EPO and WIPO under the PCT published in OJ
3/12, the search fee in respect of an international search is 1875 € The administrative fee
is 30% of the sh01tfaIl, but not less than 50 € or more than 305 €1 ADA 6.6. Although
replenishing the account with 3000 € is sufficient to pay both fees, the client should have
sent a debit order for the administrative fee —or paid the fee by any other means- within the
1 month time limit Since the debit order was not sent in time, the payment of the additional
search fee is considered to have been made on the date on which the deposit account
was duly replenished, i.e. on 22 February 2013, ADA 6.7.
The time limit set by Rule 40.1 (ii) PCT to pay the additional fee is one month from the date
of the invitation and expired on 11 February 2013, Rule 80.2 PCT. As this date is earlier
than the date on which the payment of the additional search fee is considered to have
been made, the additional search fee is not paid in time and the international search report
will be established on those parts of the International application which relate to the
invention first mentioned in the claims, i.e. claim 1, Alticle 17(3)(a) PCT.
