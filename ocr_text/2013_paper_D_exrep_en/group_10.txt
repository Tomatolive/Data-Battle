the right to file patent applications, Buona Cucina should bring entitlement proceedings for
DIVI-3D against Schnell-Koch.
Alternative A:
Take over DIVI-3D, then correct the Alticle 76 EPC problem by deleting the passage about
cubic protrusions, and file amended claims directed to a frying pan with 3D protrusions.
Alternative B.
File a new European patent application (DIVI-3D-NEW) in respect of only the subject-
matter disclosed In EP-3D, in the name of Buona Cucina, with claims directed to a frying
pan with 3D protrusions.
Provide evidence to the EPO that entitlement proceedings were brought against Schnell-
Koch, in order to stay the proceedings of DIVI-3D
DIVI-3D-NEW / DIVI-3D will be granted, and Buona Cucina will obtain the generic patent
for 3D protrusions in Germany and Italy. Any competitor of Buona Cucina will infringe DIVI
3D-NEW / DIVI-3D by manufacturing, selling or offering frying pans with any type of 3D
protrusions, in Germany or Italy.
Once Schnell-Koch staffs selling their frying pans with hemispherical or cubic protrusions,
Buona Cucina can stop Schnell-Koch in Germany or Italy by bringing infringement
proceedings against Schnell-Koch_
EP-HEMI is a dependent patent, since a frying pan with hemispherical protrusions falls
under the scope of the independent claim of DIVI-3D.
For hemispherical protrusions, Buona Cucina could negotiate a cross-license from
Schnell-Koch_ Buona Cucina's position is much stronger than Schnell-Koch's, since Buona
Cucina will have the generic patent
Evident abuse:
The disclosure of a frying pan with cubic protrusions in DIVI-3D is considered an evident
abuse in relation to Dr Serrano who is the legal predecessor of Buona Cucina (Article
EPC).
Thus, the disclosure in Schnell-Koch's application DIVI-3D will not prejudice Buona
Cucina's rights, provided that Buona Cucina files a European patent application within six
months of such publication. Therefore, file a European patent application EP-CUB in the
name of Buona Cucina, directed to a frying pan with cubic protrusions, before 27 March
2013 With this application, Buona Cucina can obtain a patent for a frying pans with cubic
protrusions in Germany and Italy. Buona Cucina can then stop Schnell-Koch from
manufacturing, selling or offering frying pans with cubic protrusions in thew German factory
by bringing infringement proceedings against Schnell-Koch_
