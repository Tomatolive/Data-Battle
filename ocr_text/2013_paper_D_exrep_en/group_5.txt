Possible solution - Paper D 2013 - Part I
Answer to question 1
For a compound to be enabled, the process for making the compound has to be disclosed.
EPI comprises a reference to the relevant specific passage of USI in which the process is
disclosed
Since the applicant submitted USI together with EPI, a copy of USI was available to the
EPO on the date of filing of EPI , and USI is pan of the file of EPI _ According to Article
128(4) EPC, after publication of EPI the file relating to EPI may be inspected by the
public on request. Therefore, USI was made available to the public on the date of
publication of EPI _
Thus, in accordance with the Guidelines H-IV, 2.31 or H-IV 2.5 or F-III 8 or decision T
737/90 the disclosure of the process in USI forms part of the content of EPI _ Hence, the
European patent discloses the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it
to be carried out by a person skilled in the art and the Opposition Division will not revoke
the patent
Answer to question 2
According to Rule 36(1) EPC, the applicant may file a divisional application relating to any
pending European patent application subject to the time limits set out in (a) and (b). Both
EPI and EP2 are pending.
a)
b)
Pursuant to Rule 36(1)(a) EPC, any divisional to EPI must be filed before the expiry
of twenty-four months from the Examining Division's first communication in respect of
the earliest application (here EPI)_ The Examining Division has not issued a
communication raising an objection that EPI does not meet the requirements of
Article 82 EPC (Rule 36(1 )(b) EPCY The first communication was deemed notified on
11 February 2011 (1 February 2011 + 10 days, Rule 126(2) EPC). Thus, a divisional
to EPI could have been filed up to 11 February 2013 Today the time limit has
expired but it was still running when the applicant attempted to file DIVI _ According to
Rule 135(2) EPC, further processing is ruled out in respect of the period under Rule
36(1)(a) EPC_ It follows from Rule 136(3) EPC, that re-establishment of rights under
Article 122 EPC is available. The request for re-establishment of rights and DIVI
have to be filed within two months of 20 February 2013 (Rule 136(1) EPC), i.e. the
request and DIVI can be filed up to 20 April 2013 This period is extended under
Rule 134(1) EPC to Monday 22 April 2013
Pursuant to Rule 36(1)(b) EPC a divisional application can be filed before the expiry
of a time limit of twenty-four months from the communication in which the Examning
Division raised a specific objection under Article 82 EPC for the first time. According
to the Guidelines A-IV, 1.1.1 _3(iv), the time limit is to be calculated from the
notification of the minutes of the telephone call. The minutes are deemed notified on
28 November 2011 (18 November 2011 + 10 days, Rule 126(2) EPC)_ Thus, the time
limit expires on 28 November 2013, and a divisional DIV2 to EP2 can still be validly
filed _
