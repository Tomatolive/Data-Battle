Examiners' Report Paper D 2013 - Part II
The second pan of the D paper requires candidates to analyse a situation concerning
various existing patent rights and suggest specific actions that are usually to be carried out
within a time limit. Care should be taken to correctly calculate the time limits.
This year the main aspects of the paper were:
Question 1
- the independent claim to a pan with 3D protrusions of EP-HEMI could not validly claim
priority from DE-HEMI, since DE-HEMI was not the first application by Schnell-Koch for
that subject-matter;
- EP-3D was pending until the expiry of the appeal period against its refusal, DIVI-3D
therefore was filed in time;
- the disclosure of pans with cubic protrusions in DIVI-3D extended beyond the content of
EP-3D, therefore no patent protection could be obtained for said subject-matter via DIVI
3D; DIVI-3D could be "repaired" by deleting the passage relating to pans with cubic
protrusions, and by filing an amended claim which overcame the clarity objection.
Comments to question 1
Surprisingly few candidates realised that the independent claim of EP-HEMI could not
enjoy priority from DE-HEMI. Apart from that, the patent situation was discussed well by
most candidates. However, many candidates did not properly indicate in which application
a specific type of protrusion was disclosed for the first time.
Most candidates realised that DIVI-3D was filed in time, i.e. within 24 months after the first
communication and before the expiry of the appeal period. They also realised that the
disclosure of a pan with cubic protrusions in DIVI-3D extended beyond the content of EP-
3D_ However, a significant number of candidates wrongly concluded that DIVI-3D could
lead to a patent for a pan with cubic protrusions on the incorrect basis that the subject-
matter of cubic protrusions could be allocated its own date of filing.
Question 2
- a translation of the notice of opposition into an official language had to be filed with the
EPO before the meeting with Mr Gusto in order to make sure that the notice of opposition
was deemed to have been filed;
- EP-3D belonged to the state of the aft under Article 54(3) EPC for the dependent claim of
EP-HEMI, and therefore could not be used for attacking inventive step thereof.
Comments to question 2
Most candidates were familiar with Article 14(4) EPC and therefore correctly identified the
need to file a translation of the notice of opposition into an official language of the EPO
However, quite a few candidates wrongly calculated the time limit for filing the translation
from the end of the opposition period
Many candidates realised that EP-3D cannot be considered for assessing the inventive
step of the dependent claim of EP-HEMI. However, a number of candidates did not come
