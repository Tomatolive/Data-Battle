Pans with cubic protrusions were disclosed by the publication of DIVI-3D_ Pans with cubic
protrusions were also disclosed at the trade fair "Hot Pans 2013".
Question 2
Analyse the status of our opposition against EP-HEMI. Discuss what can be achieved by
our opposition, and advise on any necessary actions.
The opposition period for EP-HEMI expired on 2 February 2013, carried on to 4 February
2013 The opposition was received by the EPO on time.
Buena Cucina may file the notice of opposition in Italian. However, a translation into an
EPO official language shall be filed within one month of filing the notice of opposition. The
one month period expires on 1 _32013 i.e. before the meeting with Mr Gusto.
You are entitled to file the translation because Buena Cucina's letter instructs you to act on
their behalf. You could also ask Buona Cucina to ensure that the translation is filed.
Due to the lack of novelty of the independent claim of EP-HEMI over EP-3D, the
independent claim of EP-HEMI cannot be maintained.
EP-3D belongs to the state of the art under Article 54(3) EPC and thus, EP-3D cannot be
used for attacking inventive step of the dependent claim of EP-HEMI, as incorrectly stated
in Buona Cucina's notice of opposition.
As EP-3D only belongs to the state of the art under Article 54(3) EPC, it is very likely that
Schnell-Koch will file amendments/an auxiliary request limited to the dependent claim.
Schnell-Koch would then retain a patent EP-HEMI directed to a fryng pan with
hemispherical protrusions.
Question 3
a) Are we free to act in our two markets?
b) Can we prevent our competitors from selling such pans in our two markets?
Buona Cucina cannot in particular manufacture, sell or offer frying pans with hemispherical
protrusions in Italy or in Germany, if Schnell-Koch pays the renewal fee for Germany for
EP-HEMI, since they would infringe EP-HEMI_
A frying pan with cubic protrusions falls under the scope of the independent claim of DIVI
3D_ In Italy and Germany. Buona Cucina will infringe DIVI-3D by producing frying pans
with any type of 3D protrusions in their Italian factory / by selling or offering them
Due to IT-PYR, Buena Cucina can prevent competitors from selling, offering or
manufacturing frying pans with pyramidal protrusions in Italy.
c) Can either of these positions be improved? If so, how?
True inventor:
Dr Serrano is the true inventor of the concept of 3D protrusions. He is also the true
inventor of a frying pan with cubic protrusions. Since Dr Serrano also sold Buona Cucina
