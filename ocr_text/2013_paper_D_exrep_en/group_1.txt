Examiners' Report Paper D 2013
This year candidates had the flexibility to manage the distribution of their time between
part I and part IL It was observed that some candidates had difficulties with time
management
Examiners' Report Paper D 2013 - Part I
Candidates are reminded to accept the facts given in the paper and to limit themselves to
these facts (see in particular questions 2, 3 and 4).
Candidates are also reminded to use the legal bases applicable on the date stipulated in
the Implementing Regulations In particular, this year many candidates appeared to refer
to outdated Rules relating to Fees and outdated Guidelines for Examination.
Question 1
Most candidates recognised the fact that the passage in USI is part of the content of EPI
because USI was available to the EPO on the date of filing EPI and available to the
public on the date of publication of EPI
Some candidates thought that a document cross referenced in the description of an
application IS to be treated as filing by reference under Rule 40 EPC
Several candidates suggested introducing the passage of USI into the description of EPI
although this is not necessary for sufficient disclosure of the compound.
Question 2
This question was generally well answered.
Most candidates correctly applied the provisions of Rules 36(1)(a) and 36(1)(b) EPC and
recognised that the notification of the minutes of the telephone conversation triggered the
time limit under Rule 36(1)(b) EPC
Some candidates erroneously applied Rule 133 EPC and argued that since the divisional

have been received in due time. However, the question does not contain any indication
that the divisional was received no later than three months after expiry of the time limit.
Question 3
The majority of candidates recognised that translations of the patent as amended have to
be supplied and the costs of the publication of such translations have to be paid to the
national offices
A large number of candidates did not realise that renewal fees have to be paid to the
national offices Of those that did mention the renewal fees, many wrongly referred to the
fees for the fifth year.
Although the question mentions an interlocutory decision in opposition proceedings, some
candidates referred to the provision of Rule 71 EPC rather than Rule 82 EPC
Question 4
Although it is apparent from the question that the opposition was based on an unspecified
document which was identified only after expiry of the opposition period, many candidates
