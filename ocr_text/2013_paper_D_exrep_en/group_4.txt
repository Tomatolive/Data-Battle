to the conclusion that Schnell-Koch could therefore be expected to file amendments / an
auxiliary request directed to hemispherical protrusions.
Questions 3a+b
- any type of 3D protrusion fell under the scope of DIVI-3D in Italy and Germany; Buona
Cucina therefore would Infringe DIVI-3D by producing such pans.
Comments to questions 3a+b
Most candidates recognised that Buona Cucina could use IT-PYR for preventing
competitors from manufacturing pans with pyramidal protrusions in Italy. An alarming
number of candidates incorrectly concluded that a granted IT-PYR will give Buona Cucina
freedom to produce and sell pans with pyramidal protrusions. Such advice is incorrect and
leads to substantial risk for the client. In the present case, any pan with pyramidal
protrusions will fall under the scope of any claim directed to pans with 3D protrusions.
Candidates should remember that a patent is not a positive right to operate.
Question 3c
- Dr Serrano was the true inventor of a pan with 3D protrusions and of a pan with cubic
protrusions;
- entitlement proceedings (Art 61 EPC) for DIVI-3D should be instituted against Schnell-
Koch. After the final court decision, DIVI-3D should be taken over, or a new European
patent application should be filed; thereby, Buona Cucina would obtain the generic patent
to a pan with 3D protrusions; EP-HEMI would then become a dependent patent;
- the disclosure of a pan with cubic protrusions in DIVI-3D is considered an evident abuse
(Art. 55(a) EPC); a European patent application EP-CUB therefore should be filed.
Comments to question 3c
Most candidates realised that Schnell-Koch was not entitled to a patent for a pan with 3D
protrusions or to a patent for a pan with cubic protrusions.
Many candidates suggested entitlement proceedings but often did not indicate for which
application the proceedings should be brought against Schnell-Koch_ Some candidates
inappropriately indicated EP-HEMI, EP-3D or the cubic subject-matter mentioned in DIVI-
Some candidates stated that the proceedings before the EPO would be stayed but not all
indicated the need to provide the required evidence.
Very few candidates realised that Schnell-Koch's disclosure of a pan with cubic protrusions
in DIVI-3D was an evident abuse under Alticle 55 EPC and that a new European patent
application could be filed for a pan with cubic protrusions within 6 months of the publication
of DIVI-3D
