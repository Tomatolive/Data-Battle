Answer to question 3:
On the PCT request form PCT/RO/IOI , all states and regions are automatically
designated in the sense of Rule PCT. Hence, according to Rule 4.9 (a)(iii) PCT
EP is also designated.
Patent protection in Germany can therefore still be obtained through the existing
designation of a European patent, in which the contracting state DE will have to be
designated.
The European phase for PCT-X has to be entered on or before 09 March 2007 (Rule
107(1) EPC).
Answer to question 4:
DE-I is not a first application in the sense of Art. 87(1) EPC. Art 87(4) EPC does not apply
here because DE-0 was withdrawn only after DE-I was filed, see also Guidelines, part C-
v, 1.4.
Since the priority of EP-I is invalid, the effective date of EP-I is its European filing date (01
Feb 2005). Thus, DE-0 was published before the effective date and is prior aft against EP-
1 according to Art 54(2) EPC_
It is wontl considering if the publication of DE-0 could be a non-prejudicial disclosure under
Art 55 EPC However, the publication of an application by a national office as a result of
an error is, according to T585/92 or Guidelines part C-IV 8.3 not an abuse in relation to the
applicant within the meaning of Art 55(1)(a) EPC.
Answer to question 5:
a) Concerning the automated mailbox of the EPO, the provisions are laid down in OJ
2005, 44 or notice of the EPO dated 06 Dec 2004 or Guidelines, part A-IL According
to these provisions the automated mailbox of the EPO in Munich can be used at any
time, even on days when the EPO is not open. The date of posting the application in
the automated mailbox (Sunday) 05 March 2006 is the date of filing.
Hence, the time limit of Art. 87(1) EPC expired on 05 March 2007, so filing on
06 March 2007 is too late to validly claim priority.
b) The date of filing of the first application was 03 March 2006. The priority period
according to Art. 87(1) EPC ends on 03 March 2007. As 03 March 2007 was a
Saturday, the period is extended until 05 March 2007 according to R. 85(1) EPC.
Therefore the period expired on 05 March 2007 and the priority has been validly
claimed.
