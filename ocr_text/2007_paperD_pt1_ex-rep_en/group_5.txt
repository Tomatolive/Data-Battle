Answer to question 6:
According to Art. 87(1) EPC, the right of priority belongs to the applicant of the previous
application or his successor in title.
According to Guidelines part A-III, 6.1 or J19/87, a valid transfer of the priority right under
national provisions on or before the filing date of the subsequent application is sufficient
Proof of such transfer can be filed later.
The transfer of EPI - hence the transfer of the priority right - took place in Nov 06 and was
valid under the national Polish provisions. Therefore, company M is the successor in title
for the purposes of Art 87 (1) EPC on the filing date of EP2
The right of priority can be enjoyed for 12 months from the date of filing of EPI , i.e. until 22
Dec 06.
Therefore, the priority of EPI is validly claimed.
Answer to question 7:
a) Rule 25(1) EPC states that the parent application must still be pending. An application
is pending in the sense of Rule 25 (1) EPC up to but not including the date of
publication of the mention of the grant in the Bulletin, see Guidelines part A-IV, 1.1 1 or
OJ 2/2002, P112, or notice of the EPO dated 09 Jan 2002. Hence, the divisional
application may be filed until 01 May 2007.
Although 01 May 2007 is a holiday, there is no extension to 02 May 2007 according to
Rule 85(1) EPC, since the period for filing a divisional is not a time limit.
b) The remedy of restitutio in integrum (Art 122 EPC) applies to time limits vis-Ã¤-vis the
EPO Since R. 25(1) EPC sets the condition that the earlier EP-application is pending,
it does not impose such a time limit. Hence, Alt. 122 EPC is not applicable. This was
subject of the decisions J24/03 or J18/04 and is further referred to in the Guidelines,
pan A-IV, 1.1_1
Answer to question 8:
Generally, according to Art 104(1 )EPC or Guidelines, part E-IV 1.9, each party to
opposition proceedings shall meet the costs he has incurred.
Since Mr. A is a party to the opposition proceedings in the sense of Art 99(4) EPC, the
taking of evidence was hearing of a party, Art 117(1 )(a) EPC Hence, Mr. A is not entitled
to reimbursement
Since Mr. X is a client of Mr. A, he is not a party to the proceedings. In his case, the taking
of evidence was the heanng of a witness or an expert in the sense of Art. 117(1)(d) or (e)
EPC
