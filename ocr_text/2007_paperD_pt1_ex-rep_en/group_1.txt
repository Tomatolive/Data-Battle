Examiners' Report Paper D 2007 Part I
GENERAL
The candidates are reminded to read the questions carefully and to use the information
given therein. Failure to do so can result in overlooking issues, which are expected to be
discussed, or in applying inappropriate provisions (e.g. EPC instead of PCT) or simply in
answering questions not posed.
Candidates are also reminded to provide legal basis in thew reasoning.
The candidates are expected to give a consistent answer to a question. When
contradictory alternatives are given, no marks are awarded.
Legible handwriting is appreciated.
Question 1
This question was generally well answered. Some candidates missed marks because they
either did not calculate the time limit for paying the fees at all or because they calculated it
incorrectly. A few candidates overlooked that the question was related to an international
application and not to a European application, because they referred to Art. 78(2) EPC for
the filing fee and the search fee. These candidates got no marks.
Question 2
Many candidates only referred to Art. 23(2) or 40(2) PCT and Rule 107 EPC and were not
aware that it is also necessary to request PACE for examination to start as soon as
possible According to the Notice of the President, "PACE" is explicitly available also for
international applications entering the European phase. Only very few candidates correctly
noted that the stan of examination can further be accelerated by waiving the right to
receive an invitation from the EPO to confirm that the applicant desires to proceed with the
application.
Question 3
The majority of candidates correctly noted that in principle protection in Germany can be
obtained via a European patent But many candidates did not provide a satisfactory chain
of reasoning how this principle has to be applied starting from the given situation In
particular only very few candidates calculated the time limit for entering the European
phase. This calculation was expected, because only if the time limit had not lapsed yet,
could a European patent be granted through which protection in Germany could be
obtained. In addition often no legal basis was cited at all.
Question 4
Most candidates correctly analysed the involved priority problem and concluded that the
priority of EPI is invalid. However, many candidates completely ignored the information
given in the question concerning the internal processing error of the German Patent and
Trademark Office, which was an indication that the issue of non-prejudicial disclosure
under Art. 55 EPC was expected to be discussed.
