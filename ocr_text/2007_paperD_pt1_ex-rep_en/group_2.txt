Question 5
This question did not pose a serious problem to most candidates. However, a considerable
number of candidates did not discuss which filing date is accorded to an application filed
on a day when the EPO is not open. Only few candidates knew that this issue is treated in
a Notice of the EPO
Question 6
A considerable number of candidates did not calculate the priority period and therefore did
not check whether EPI had been filed within this period.
Furthermore many candidates erroneously applied Rule 20(3) EPC to the transfer of the
right of priority based on EPI thereby coming to the conclusion, that at the date of filing of
EP2 company M was not the successor in title of EPI and thus priority was not validly
claimed. Some of these candidates were aware of J 19/87 but argued that this decision is
concerned with the transfer of a national first application where national law applies
whereas the present case is concerned with the transfer of a European first application
where the provisions of the EPC should apply. From this, these candidates deduced that
Rule 20(3) EPC is applicable to the transfer of the right of priority based on the European
application EPI _ This argumentation is not correct because Rule 20(3) applies to the
transfer of a European application and not to the transfer of a priority right as such, which
is never registered.
Question 7
This question was generally well answered. Full marks could often not be awarded
because candidates did not realize that Rule 85(1) EPC is not applicable since the period
for filing a divisional application is not a time limit In pan b) some candidates wrongly
referred to Art 122(5) EPC not realizing that in connection with divisional applications this
Article does not concern the period for filing such an application but the time limit for
paying fees therefor
Question 8
Many candidates failed to distinguish clearly between the taking of evidence by hearing a
party and the taking of evidence by hearing a witness. The relevant Article 117(1)(a) and
(d) EPC was rarely mentioned.
Question 9
The majority of candidates correctly referred to Rule 87 EPC and suggested filing different
sets of claims for different states. The most common reason for losing marks was that the
time limit for paying the designation fees for Dl had not been estimated thus missing the
fact that the validly designated states were already determned_ Some candidates
overlooked that Dl is a European application and not a national application. Some
candidates did not discuss the situation for not commonly designated states.
Question 10
This question was reasonably well answered However, some candidates seem not to
have brought along the National law relating to the EPC to the exam and therefore could
not obtain many marks for this question. Surprisingly, some candidates thought it
necessary to file a translation for GB_
