Croatia is not a contracting state of the EPC, and has not made an agreement to be an
extension state. Therefore. protection in Croatia by a European application is not possible.
Ireland, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Switzerland are all contracting states of the EPC, and so
a single European application Can cover these. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have agreed
under Article 149(1) EPC that they may only be designated together. Accordingly, only one
designation fee is due in respect of the combined Liechtenstein/Switzerland designation.
Slovenia does have an extension agreement with the EPO. Accordingly, when filing a
European application, a request can be made to extend this to Slovenia.
Therefore, an application should be filed at the EPO. The filing and search fee must be paid
within I month Of filing - Article 78(2) EPC, although these may be paid within a grace
period of I month from notification from the EPO under Rule 8Sa(l) EPC

priority is claimed, or the later of 12 months of priority and one month of filing if priority
is claimed. Under Rule 85a(l) EPC, a I month perlod Of grace from notification is available
for payment of the designation fees, or, if this notification is dispensed with, a 2 month
period from the due date - Rule 85a(2) EPC. In either case, a 50% surcharge is due.

is the same as the designation fee, must be paid by the normal due date under Article 79<2)
EPC for paying designation fees. The 2 month grace period under Rule 85a(2) EPC is
available for payment with a 50% surcharge.
