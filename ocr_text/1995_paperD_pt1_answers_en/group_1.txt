The application will be published.
Rule 48(2) EPC provides that the application will not be published if withdrawm before
technical preparations for publication are complete.
President's Notice of 14.12.92 and Guidelines A-VI, l. I provide technical preparations will
be completed 7 weeks before 18 month date.
Therefore, application is deemed withdrawn before technic preparations are completed. and
so will not be published.
(i) Yes, file a new application. As the EPO was not open for the filing of documents on
14-17 April 1995 (President's Notice 10.11.94), an application may be filed on 18 Apnl
validly claiming priority from 14 April 1994 as the period under Article 87(1) EPC is
extended by virtue of Rule 85(1) EPC to the next day on which all filing offices of the
EPO are open.
Therefore, file a new application today, 18 April 1995 claiming the valid priority date
Of 14 April 1994. The application filed on 14 April 1995 may be abandoned.
(ii) Yes, it is too late to file a new application claiming priority
However. correction can be made to a missing or wrong pnority claim under Rule 88
EPC This was held to be allowed in J2/92. J3/91, J6/91 and J9/91 and Other cases. The
burden Of proof of error is very low
(In theory, there is no reason Why a Rule 88 EPC correction could not be used for
but it is better to have an application claiming valid priority without requiring
correction').
Request is inadmissible.
Under Article 122(2) EPC, a request for re-establishment must be made within 12 months
following the expiry Of the time limit. For renewal fees, this period will expire 12 months
after the original due date, i.e. 12 months from 30 September 1993. This period expires on
30 September 1994 applying Rule 83(4) EPC
It is also necessary for the application to be made, the omitted act completed. and the fee
paid within 2 months Of removal Of the reason for non-compliance. This removal probably
took place on notification from the EPO - J27/90. This notification was dated on
5 August 1994, and so by Rule 78(1) and (3) EPC will be deemed to be notified 10 days
later, namely 15 August 1994. The 2 month period from this date will end 15 October 1994
