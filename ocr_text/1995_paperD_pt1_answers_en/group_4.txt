File a new application, claiming pnority from the original application. Withdraw the
incorrect European application.
Because the new application can still claim the original priority date, there will be no
loss Of rights in withdrawmg the existing application and filing a new one. (In view Of
G3/93, it should be ensured that there is no possible intervening disclosure between the
filing of the existing EP application and new European application. If there has been,
further consideration may be required).
Altematively, Figure 2 may immediately be filed, in which case the application will be
re-dated to the date of filing the drawings - Rule 43(1) EPC, Article 91(6) EPC. These
options both involve no additional cost, and so may be equally acceptable, but I would
prefer filing a new case to ensure everything is filed together, in case my Other pages
were originally missing in the original European application.
Either file the drawing and lose priority, or do not file the drawing, keep the priority
date, but lose references to the drawing. Under Article 80 EPC, all requirements have
been met to give the application a date Of filing.
The EPO will therefore examine the application to check. inter alia, whether the
drawings were filed on the date Of filing - Article EPC,
In this case, Figure 2 was not filed, and so Article 91(6) EPC applies.
Under Rule 43(2) EPC, the EPO will set a one month term to file the drawings. Ifthe
drawings are filed within this term, the application will be re-dated to the date On which
the drawings are received. Accordingly, the priority claim will be lost as the filing date
will be more than 12 months from the date of filing the priority application - Art-
icie 87 EPC.
If the drawings are not filed, then Rule 43(2) EPC and Article 91(6) EPC provides that
the references to the drawings will be deleted. Nevertheless, in this case the priority
date remains.
The advice must therefore be to file the drawings as soon as possible, but lose the
priority date if this is Of no value.
Alternatively. do not file the drawings, and let all reference to them be deleted, but
keep the priority date. In this case, no protection will be available covering
Figure 2, but this may be filed a separate application if this is merited, but the
priority date will remain. This may be important.
Due from the date Of filing, or where priority is claimed, the priority
date - Article 91(5) EPC
If not done on time, the application is deemed - Art 91(5) EPC
