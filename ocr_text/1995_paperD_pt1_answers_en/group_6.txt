Regarding Croatia, a separate national application must be filed. (Croatia is not a PCT state,
and so a PCT application would not be possible).
10. Pay 3rd year renewal fee + surcharge by 31 July 1995. File a notice of appeal and pay
fee by 18 April 1995, and file grounds including amendments by 19 June 1995
Article 86(1) EPC provides that renewal fees are due in respect Of 3rd and subsequent years
from filing Therefore, the third year renewal fee is due in respect Of the year from 09.01.95
to 08.01.96. By Rule 37(1) EPC, this fee should have been paid by the last day Of the month
containing the anniversary Of the filing, i.e. by 31.01.95. This date has been missed.
Article 86(2) EPC gives a 6 month period from the due date on which the renewal fee may
validly be paid, together with a surcharge (10% - Article 2(5) EPC Fee Rules). By the
decision of J4/91, this period expires on the last day of the relevant subsequent month,
namely on 31 July 1995. (This is not an excluded day).
The renewal fee plus 10% surcharge must be paid by 31 Julv 1995
The decision from the EPO must be appealed. An appeal notice, and fee, must be filed
within 2 months of the date of notification of the decision - Article 108 EPC
By Rule 78(1) and (3) EPC, the notification is deemed made 10 days after the
communication is sent (this being the deemed date of receipt unless it is actually received
later). Accordingly, notification is deemed to be made on 17 February 1995. By Rule 83(4)
EPC, the 2 month perlod wtll therefore expire on 17 April 1995. This is an excluded day
(President's notice 10.11.94) and therefore, under Rule 850) EPC, the due date will be the
next day on which all filing offices of the EPO are open, namely 18 April.
A notice of appeal must be filed by April 1995.
Also within 4 months of notification, Article 108 EPC requires a written statement with the
grounds Of appeal to be filed. Applying Rule 83(4) EPC. this penod ends on 17 June 1995.
This is a Saturday and so is an excluded day (President's Notice 10.11.94).
Applying Rule 85(1) EPC, the period is extended, and expires 19 June 1995.
Accordingly. the grounds Of appeal must be filed by 19 June 1995.
The grounds of appeal should include the amendments suggested by the Examiner. In this
case, there must be an interlocutory revision under Article 109(1) EPC This means that the
decision to refuse must be set aside. (It is unlikely that the appeal fee will be reimbursed
under Rule 67 EPC as there was no substantial procedural violation.)
