5 "In late 1998 we developed a new class of polymers which we refer to as blottanes. Blottanes
were developed as part Of Our research into moisture-absorbent fibrous materials. Blottanes
were found to have an extremely high affinity for water. Other materials are known that can
absorb and release high quantities of water, but they deteriorate after several cycles Of wetting
and drying. Blottanes do not have this problem. We found blottanes to be difficult to process
10 and the production method we developed is only capable of making short fibres, and not
capable of forming continuous fibres. Until recently (I will explain below) we could see no
apparent way Of making thread from these short fibres. We could however make non-woven
textiles and papers out of these fibres. One blottane in particular, which wc called product
was dramatically better than the other blottanes since it was found to absorb odours. However,
15 because of raw material costs, product X is more expensive to make than the other blottanes.
On Thursday, 15 October 1998, we filed British application B-GBI, which described blottanes
in general and how they can be made in the form of short fibres. B-GB I also described the use
20 of blottanes and product X as moisture-retaining material in composts, and mentioned that
the nomvoven textiles and papers could be used in such applications as disposable nappies,
tampons and incontinence clothing. B-GBI had two claims, one directed to blottanes in general
and the other directed to product X. In mid-1999 we started approaching potential users of
blottanes to see whether they would be interested in blottanes and product X.

On Wednesday, 1 September 1999, we filed a PCT application, B-PCT, claiming the priority
Of B-GB 1 , designating the USA, Europe and Japan only, and with a description and claims
30 identical to B-GBI. In January 2000, we received the PCT search report which had no
citations.
