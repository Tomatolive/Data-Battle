Also in January 2000 we granted a licence to the Swiss company Pure Agrochemical.
Pure are licensed to use blottanes in composts and in connection with the licence they asked
that a European divisional application be filed directed solely to composts, and that it should
be assigned to them when granted. Pure were not interested in product X, as they had no
5 need to absorb odours. On I February 2000 we entered the European regional phase early,
as application B-EUI, without any amendments and paying designation fees for all EPC
contracting states. That same day we filed a divisional application, B-EU2, which has claims
and a description directed solely to composts containing blottanes. To keep down future
translation costs, the description of B-EU2 as filed is much shorter than that Of B-EUI and
10 mentions neither the other uses of blottanes nor product X. Designation fees for B-EU2 were
paid for all EPC contracting states.
At about this time we also had very strong interest from Feuchtfurcht GmbH, a manufacturer
15 of disposable nappies, in using product X in their products. On 18 February 2000, we filed the
demand for international preliminary examination in respect of B-PCT, requested accelerated
prosecution of B-EUI and asked for an interview with the examiner to discuss both B-PCT
and B-EUI.

In April 2000, B.PCT was published and in May 2000 we attended an interview with the
examiner to discuss B-PCT and B-EUI. The interview went well and the examiner was
prepared to accept the patentability Of the claims as filed. In August 2000, the communication
under Rule 51 (4) EPC was issued on B-EUI , as was the international preliminary examination
25 report on B-PCT. In October 2000, I approved the text of application B-EUI and in
January 2001, I received thc communication under Rule 51(6) EPC. On I March 2001,
I paid the grant fee and filed the translations of the claims and asked for immediate grant.
30 Until two weeks ago I thought we were in a good position. However, I have now received
the search report on B-EU2. The search report reveals a European application, NF-EUI , in
the name of Niffy Shoe Liners Ltd., an Irish company, who manufacture disposable shoe
