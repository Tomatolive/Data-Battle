liners. NF-EUI was filed on Tuesday, I June 1999, and claims the priority ofNF-IEl filed
on Thursday, 15 October 1998, NF-EUI has the same description and claims as NF-IEI.
Niffy's application describes product A, a member of a new class of polymers, and also the
moisture-absorbent properties of the new class of polymers in general. This class in fact is
5 the identical class of polymers as blottanes and I will refer to it hereafter as blottanes. NY-EUI
also discloses an ingenious process for rnaking blottanes in the form of continuous fibres and
describes the use of these fibres in the form of a woven textile in shoe liners. No other specific
uses for blottanes are disclosed. NE-EU I claims use of blottanes in general as moisture-
absorbent materials, blottanes in the form Of a woven textile, and the process for producing the
10 continuous fibres from blottanes. The examination fee and all designation fees in respect of
NE-EUI were paid in November 2000.
The search report also reveals an earlier application by Niffy, NF-EU2. NF-EtJ2 was filed
15 on Wednesday, 30 September 1998. NF-EU2 describes blottanes in general, the same process
for producing the continuous fibres as disclosed in NY-EU 1, and product A in the form of a
woven textile for use in shoe liners. NF•EU2 also describes product A as having anti-static
properties and preventing static build-up in shoes in Contrast to other blottanes, which NF-EU2
refers to as Of no practical use. NF-EU2 has claims directed to use Of product A for its anti-
20 static properties, product A in the form Ofa woven textile, and the process for producing the
continuous fibres from blottanes. NF-EU2 claims the priority of, and has the same description
as, an Irish application, NF-IE2, filed on I October 1997. NF-EU2 was published as an
A2 document in April 1999. Mention of the A3 publication was published in the Bulletin in
August 2000. From inspection Of the electronic register, the designation fees for NF•EU2 do
25 not appear to have been paid; the renewal fee due in September 2000 has however been paid.
Luckily, neither NF-EUI nor NF-EU2 describes product X.
