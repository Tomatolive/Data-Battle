Could you please advise us in detail as to the patentability in the EPC contracting
states of the subject matter of NF-EUI and NF-EU2?
Could you please advise us whether the subject matter Of B-EUI and B-EU2 is
patentable in the EPC contracting states, in view Of the Niffy applications? If not,
is there any action we can take to improve our position?
Could the Niffy applications cause us any problems in exploiting blottanes in the
EPC contracting states?
What action can we take to stop Niffy using blottanes in the EPC contracting states?
Feuchtfurcht have recently advised that they would like a European divisional application with
15 claims directed to disposable nappies containing product X to be filed, or, less preferably, to
have such claims in B-EUI. They are willing to pay 1 000 000 Euros for assignment of such a
divisional application. They have also asked whether we can supply product X in the forrn of a
woven textile.

Can we validly file such a European divisional application based on B-EUI or
B-EU2?
Can Niffy stop us from supplying product X as a woven textile to Feuchtfurcht
in the EPC contracting states?"
