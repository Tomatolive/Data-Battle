B
Also, since PCT is to designate USA, method of treatment claims (using X
or Z and for hypotensive effect, antiviral effect) should be included.
(Not alloving under EPC A 52(4) - but acceptable in US.
(1) Entitlement action in front of DK court, since Smart is entitled to
aspects in EP 3
- as discussed above. By A 61(1) if judged entitled or
partially entitled (R 16), Smart will have several remedies (listed in
A available).
Action must be in DK court (l) because of contractual provision for
those inventions the contracts apply to and (2) because of A 2 of the
Protocol on Recognition.
Then prove opening of the proceedings to the EPO, who vill stay the
proceedings following publication of the application - Rule 13(1) EPC.
Smart ought to succeed on entitlement to Process B, given the contract
and hig inventorship. If the rest belongs to Grisk this vill not affect
a later application
(1) claiming priority from DK 1 for the matter contained therein and
(2) directed to antL-vLra1 properties of product X (not disclosed in EP 3).
(II) Until the EPO has proof of initiation of entitlement proceedings, Grisk
might withdraw EP 3. Thereafter, R 14 would prevent Grisk from
withdrawing it or any designation.
It is in Smart's interest to keep the application alive to keep rights
to Process B pending (on the assumption that he will win entitlement) .
This makes sure he has an effective date before the disclosure to
Albatross. If that vere not in confidence it vould be effective prior
art to a later appl [cation claiming Process B, unless the contractual
provision relating to non-disclosure by Grisk can be made effective by
filing a European application within 6 months of the disclosure.
Griskis disclosure Is In breach of contract and an â€¢evident abuse"
within the meaning of A 55(1)(a) EPC.
Thus, a European application could be filed up to 6 months after Grisk's
filing of EP 3 and the disclosure would be ignored. EP 3, even if
published, would not be prior art to a claim to Process B taking a
priority date later than the filing date of EP 3, because A 55 EPC vould
apply to the filing of EP 3 .
Thus, Smart's best chance at protection for process B, in the absence Of
cooperation Vith Grisk, is an entitlement dispute and then filing an
A 61 (I) (b) application.
Note, though, R 14 would prevent Withdrawal Of EP 3 once proceedings had
been proven to the EPO to have been opened, at the moment, certain
steps, as discussed above, need to be performed to keep EP 3 in force.
G 3/93 is asking whether the original application must be pending for an
application to be filed under A 61 (I) person can pay fees
