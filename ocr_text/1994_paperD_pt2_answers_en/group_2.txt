Thus, If PCT 2 is filed designating EPO (or an EPO application is filed)
and the priority Of DK I ig claimed by Smart, EP 3 Vill have to claim
only subject matter which is novel over the content Of DK I (applying
A 54(3) in view of the effect Of A 89 on the effective date Of an
application (validly) claiming an earlier priority date) .
This would be Process B (owned by Smart) , Process C, the separation
process and hypotensive effect Of Z (owned by Grisk).
However, if all the parties cooperate, there is no need to keep EP 3 in
force: everything can be put into a later PCT or EP application and
priority claimed from both DK I and EP 3. A partial transfer assigrnent
of EP 3 to Smart would validate full priority rights for the later
application.
This disclosure to Albatross, whether in confidence or not, would
post-date priority dates for DK I and EP 3 and would do no to
claims to subject matter in those earlier tvo applications.
There is no need to keep EP 3 in force in order for It to be possible to
claim its priority - A 4.A. (3) Paris Convention.
A (i i i) There is no reason Why not if all parties cooperate.
(a) NO - process C and the other Vork Of Grisk should included as
well .
(b) Grisk and Smart should both be applicants for all States. unless
Grisk assigns his rights to Smart before filing, in vhich case Smart
would be applicant for all States and Grisk applicant for US only
(applicant must be inventor in US - national Iav is determinative -
PCT A 27).
(c) Claim both priorities (DK 1 + EP 3) to avoid potential problem Vith
disclosure to Albatross (as discussed above - dates precede
disclosure). (A European application can serve as a basis for
claiming priority because A 66 EPC renders it equivalent to a
national filing and A 4 A Paris Convention covers chis.)
(d) Claims as incorporated in (Question paper page 2) .
