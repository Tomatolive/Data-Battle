(A 7 - RRF - Legal Advice 6/91) but only the applicant (Grisk) can file
the translation required by A 14(2)
(iV) PCT filing date is equivalent to EP filing date, by virtue Of
A 150(4). Thus, A 55 will apply equally, as vill other provisions.
All EPO states are party to PCT.
PCT gives a chance to delay major costs of filing.
File a PCT.
(Argument in favour of direct EP 2 vould be that It would be quicker to
grant: - this would probably not be an advantage here. )
For other countries, direct filing might be thought safer - though PCT
filing date is equivalent to direct filing date.
Grisk Ls an inventor of process B so his disclosure to Albatross vill
not be prior art to a US within 1 year Of the disclosure
(B5 USC 102b).
PCT filing would not require a signature by Grisk if filed by Smart with
Smart as first applicant -
common representative under R 90.2 PCT. This
puts off time for signature till US National Phase.
(a) Smart should be applicant.
(b) Both EP 3 and DK 1, pending entrance of entitlement, though the most
important thing is to file within 6 months of EP 3 and Albatross
disclosure to invoke effect of A 55 and enable Process B to be claimed:
not a problem since DK 1 priority must be claimed by 3 June 1993.
Priority claim to EP 3 vill be invalid if entitlement proceedings fail:
A 87 (1) - different applicants! (As discussed above.)
(c) Claim everything from DK 1 Process B
Use of Product X in the manufacture of a medicament for antiviral
the rapy
- dependent claims to the 3 specific Viruses.
If PCT - method of treatment claims
- treating viral infections or
giving hypotensive effect using Product X.
B (iii) Be sure to claim them in patent applications
