The letters of Dr S. prior to the effective date are not prior art as they were in
confidence. The disclosure of hemispherical protrusions at the conference is not
prior aft as it is after the effective date of EP-Hem_ Therefore it should be possible
to obtain protection for hemispherical protrusions via EP-Hemi.
EP-Hemi has only been validated in Italy. However due to the London agreement
certam countries do not require a translation of the specification for validation
Therefore this application will have automatically validated in certain countries.
Germany is party to the London agreement and so EP-Hemi will have automatically
validated in Germany.
This is subject to payment of renewals which in Germany are due in respect of the
third year onwards.
The third year renewal is due.
54.10 30.4.12
and this would have been payable to the EPO as it was before mention of grant.
The fourth year renewal is due
304.13
is not yet due
Therefore protection in Germany can be obtained from EP-Hemi.
d) Cubic protrusions
This shape protrusion has only been mentioned in DIV-3D_ However this was not
disclosed in the parent application and thus is an extension beyond the parent
application as filed and is unallowable.
This can be remedied during prosecution of DIV-3D but it means that protection for
cubic protrusions cannot be obtained via DIV-3D. No other applications cover cubic
protrusions.
The idea of cubic protrusions was published on 27.9.12 when DIV-3D published and
also was disclosed at the Lot Pons 2013 trade fair.
Therefore it is not possible to file any new applications for cubic protrusions as these
will lack novelty over these disclosures. Therefore no protection can be obtained for
cubic protrusions.
Summary
3D protrusions can be protected in Germany and Italy via DIV-3D once granted by
Pyramidal protrusions are protected in Italy only via IT-PYR by you (BC)
