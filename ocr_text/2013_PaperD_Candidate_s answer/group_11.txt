The Notice of Opposition was received by the EPO on 12.13 and therefore it is
considered to be filed on this day therefore it has been filed in time.
The Opposition is admissible as the opposition fee has been paid and a written
reasoned statement has been submitted.
The Notice of Opposition sets out the extent and the ground and provides an
indication of the facts and evidence.
The Notice of Opposition needs to be filed in an official language of the EPO (EN
However, given that you are a legal person having your principle place of business in
a contracting state with an official language (IT) which is not an official language of
the EPO you are entitled to file the notice of opposition in the official language of that
state (Italian). This will entitle you to a 20% discount of the opposition fee (this 20%
will be refunded if you paid the full opposition fee). However a translation into EN,
FR or DE needs to be filed by the later of (i) the period for filing the opposition or (ii)
one month of filing the Notice of Opposition.
The period for filing the Notice of Opposition has already expired (4.213). However
1 month from filing the notice of opposition = 1 2.13 + 1 month = 1 _313 (Friday).
This deadline has not expired.
We need to file a translation of the Notice of Opposition into EN, DE or FR by 1_3.13.
If not filed by this date the Opposition will be deemed not filed. As a professional
representative under A134(1) EPC I can act on your behalf and I do not need
authorisation (i.e. a power of attorney) to do so.
I will therefore proceed to have the Notice of Opposition translated into one of the
official languages ofthe EPO (EN, DE, FR) and file it at the EPO BY
In respect of the likely success of the Opposition, EP-Hemi contains two claims:
Claim 1
Claim 2.
a frying pan with 3D protrusions
the frying pan of claim 1 wherein the 3D protrusions are hemispherical.
