DIVI-3D should be possible to obtain protection for a frying pan with 3D protrusions
on its inner surface in Germany and Italy (if the reference to cubic protrusions IS
removed). The claim can specify the features to achieve a surface that will heat up
the food faster and so should not be objected to as a result to be achieved.
DE-Hemi also clams a frying pan with 3D protrusions. However this application is
deemed withdrawn due to non-payment of the filing fee and so cannot be used to
obtain protection for this invention.
EP-Hemi claims priority from DE-Hemi.
EP-Hemi was filed by the same applicant, directed to the same invention and within
the 12 months priority period. It is also irrelevant that De-Hemi was subsequently
deemed withdrawm However DE-Hemi was not the first application by S-K to the
idea of a frying pan with 3D protrusions as this was jus described in EP-3D.
Therefore in respect of the claim directed to a frying pan with 3D protrusions the
priority claim from DE-Hemi is not valid. Therefore the effective date of claim 1 of
EP-Hemi is its filing date, i.e 54.10. EP-3D was published before the effective date
of claim 1 of EP-Hemi and so is full prior art
Therefore claim 1 of EP-Hemi directed to a frying pan with 3D protrusions is invalid
Despite this EP-Hemi has been granted with claim 1 but we can attack this in the
Opposition as discussed below.
c) Hemispherical protrusions
This is first described in DE-Hemi filed 106.09. This application has since been
deemed withdrawn and so it is not possible to obtan protection for hemispherical
protrusions via this application. EP-Hemi was filed 15.1210 claiming priority from
DE-Hemi_
The priority claim in respect of hemispherical protrusions is valid because they were
filed by the same applicant, the applications are directed to the same invention.
EP-Hemi was filed in the 12 month priority period of DE-Hem
(1.609 + 12 months -
DE-Hemi was the first application to hemispherical protrusions DE-Hemi was filed
in a PC state. It is irrelevant to priority that DE-Hemi was subsequently withdrawn.
Therefore the effective date of a claim to a frying pan with hemispherical protrusions
in EP-Hemi has an effective date of 10_6.09_
EP-3D was filed before the effective date of EP-Hemi but was published after.
Therefore it is prior art under A54(3) EPC and is relevant to the assessment of
novelty only.
EP-3D does not disclose hemispherical protrusions and thus the EP-Hemi claim to
hemispherical protrusions is novel over this prior art and thus valid in view of this art
