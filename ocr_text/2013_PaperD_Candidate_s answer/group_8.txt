EP-Hemi was also published before the effective date of IT-PYR and so is full prior
art. But it does not disclose pyramidal protrusions and therefore IT-PYR is novel and
inventive over this disclosure.
The disclosure at hot pans conference and the publication of DIV-3D were both
published after the effective date of IT-PYR and therefore are not prior art
Therefore it should be possible to obtain protection for pyramidal protrusions in Italy.
3D-protrusions (a)
EP-3D was filed January 2008 without a claim to priority therefore the effective date
of EP-3D is January 2008. There is no relevant disclosures before this date. The
letters by Dr S to SK is November 2007 and March 2008 were in confidence and
therefore are not prior an.
EP-3D was refused on 26 March 2012. The deadline for filing an appeal was
26.32012 + 10 days + 2 months = 5_6.12
Therefore it is now too late to file an appeal for EP-3D_ Therefore there are no rights
conferred by this application. A divisional DIVI-3D was filed based on EP-3D, on 1
June 2012
This divisional met the requirements of R36(1 ) EPC because EP-3D was still
"pending" as the time limit for filing an appeal had not expired when DIVI-3D was
filed
(DIVI-3D was filed 1 June 2012 before 5 June 2012 which was the deadline for filing
the Notice of Appeal on EP-3D_
Also the first Communication from the Examining Division issued July 2010 so the 24
month period of R36(1)(a) EPC would expire around July 2012 and so DIVI-3D was
filed before this date
Therefore DIVI-3D was validly filed. DIVI-3D extends the subject matter of the
application beyond EP-3D which is not allowable as it contains an additional
statement regarding cubic protrusions. However this deficiency can be rectified
during prosecution of DIVI-3D_
DIVI-3D inherits the filing date of EP-3D and so the effective date of DIVI-3D is
January 2008
As discussed above there is no relevant prior art before this deadline before DIVI-3D
can be used to obtan protection for a frying pan with three-dimensional protrusions
on the inner surface of the frying pam
Designation fees for only Germany and Italy were paid on EP-3D. Therefore DIVI-3D
can only designate Germany and Italy.
