In respect of protection specifically to hemispherical protrusions you will also infringe
claim 2 of EP-Hemi (which appears to be valid). This claim is granted and therefore
you are QQ! free to sell frying pans with hemispherical protrusions in Italy or
Germany.
You have rights to pyramidal protrusions in Italy only. There are not rights in cubic
protrusions. However, sales of frying pans with pyramidal protrusions or cubic
protrusions will still infringe claims to 3-D protrusions from EP-Hemi (until revoked)
and DIV-3D (when granted).
b) Currently you are only able to prevent sales of frying pans with pyramidal
protrusions by SK in Italy. SK are currently free to sell frying pans with protrusions of
any shape in Germany and only shape except pyramidal protrusions in Italy.
It is clear that SK have stolen the idea to a frying pan with 3D protrusions from
Dr S. You have good evidence of this as you have a copy of the letter of November
2007 which descrbes 3D protrusions on the inner surface of frying pans which was
before the filing date of EP-3D. You should therefore file a clam to the grant of DIV-
3D in the Courts of Germany (where SK as applicant have their principal place of
business).
You should also notify the EPO of these proceedings who will stay the proceedings
of DIV-3D
Given the good evidence you have the German Courts should find you entitled to
DIV-3D. This is because Dr S has sold you the rights in his invention. You can then
either file a new application to the original subject-mater of EP-3D or continue
prosecution of DIV-3D
You will then be able to obtain protection in Germany and Italy for a frying pan with
3D protrusions. This will allow you to prevent SK selling frying pans wth only
shaped protrusion in Germany and Italy.
You will be free to sell frying pans with pyramidal and cubic protrusions but not
hemispherical protrusions only. SK will obtain protection for hemispherical
protrusions in Italy and Germany SK are entitled to his subject-matter as Dr S did
not suggest hemispherical protrusions to SK. This disclosure of cubic protrusions via
DIV-3D and at the trade fair were result of evidence abuse as Dr S had told SK of
this idea in confidence. Therefore within 6 months of the first disclosure i.e. by
27.9.12 plus 6 months = 27 _3_13.
You can file an EP application to a frying pan with cubic protrusions as the disclosure
by publication of DIV-3D and at the trade fair are non-prejudcial disclosures (Art 55
EPC). There is no other disclosure of cubic protrusions and this is inventive over the
other shapes as it makes the food crispier. Therefore you should be able to obtain
protection for cubic protrusions in Italy and Germany.
To enable you to sell frying pans with hemispherical protrusions you could consider a
cross licence with SK However, you are in a strong position (you can currently stop
SK selling frying plans with only shaped protrusion) but I would not recommend a
