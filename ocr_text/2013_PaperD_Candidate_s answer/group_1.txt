The patent needs to disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and
complete for it to be carried out (A83 EPC)_
Therefore EPI needs to describe how compound X is obtained for it to be sufficient
References in the patent may relate to part of the disclosure of invention (GL-F1118).
What is in the reference document USI is essential for carrying out the invention
(A83 EPC). Reference documents are not part of the text translated pursuant to A65
and so any essential disclosure should be in the patent itself
The USI was filed at the time of filing EPI and therefore was available to the EPO at
the time of filing and would have been published in the file of EPI (A128(1) EPC)
when EPI was published (A93(1) EPC)_
A feature only described in a reference document is prima facie not pan of the
description T689/90. However a feature only described in a reference document is
part of the content of the application as filed if no doubt to the skilled reader that
such features:
a) are/might want to be protected
b) contrbute to achieving the technical aim of the invention
c) implicitly clearly belong to the description of the invention
d) are precisely defined and are identifiable in the total technical information
within the reference document (T689/90).
Thus the reference to USI will be considered part of EPI as filed and thus
amendments to incorporate the text of the specific referenced passage of USI into
the description of EPI Will not contravene A123(2) EPC Amendments may be made
if they are to overcome a ground of opposition A80 EPC Thus you will be able to
amend the description of EPI based on the specific referenced passage of USI to
overcome the deficiency.
Thus it should be possible to maintain EPI with an amended description.
