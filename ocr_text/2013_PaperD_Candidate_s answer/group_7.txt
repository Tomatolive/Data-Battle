Leqal Opinion
1 ) Your rights (Pyramidal protrusions (b))
You filed IT-PYR on 19 August 2011 this contains a single claim to a frying pan with
pyramidal protrusions on its inner surface. This application was filed in Italy only.
No further applications have been filed. We are more than 12 months after the filing
date of IT-PYR and therefore the priority period has expired and we are too late to
file any applications claimng priority from IT-PYR_
19 August 2011 + 12 months - 19 August 2012 (Sunday)
so the deadline for filing applications claiming priority from IT-PYR was 20 August
2012.
This deadline has been missed. It is not possible to withdraw this application and file
a new application staffing a new priority year as IT-PYR has been laid open to public
inspection.
Also as it has been published it is not possible to file any fufther applications (not
claiming priority) to the idea of a frying pan with pyramidal protrusions as this will
lack novelty over the publication of IT-PYR on February 2013
You could file an application in the US relying on the 12 month grace period, i.e. by
February 2014, if you want protection for pyramidal protrusions in the US
However no other applications can be filed. Therefore you only have protection for
pyramidal protrusions in Italy.
Prior art to IT-PYR
EP-3D was published before the filing date of IT-PYR
IT-PYR does not claim priority and therefore its effective date is 19.811 (its filing
date).
EP-3D is full prior art for novelty and inventive step EP-3D does not disclose
pyramidal protrusions and there is no mention of protrusion shape Pyramidal
protrusions have an advantage of less vitamin loss and therefore is inventive over
EP-3D_
