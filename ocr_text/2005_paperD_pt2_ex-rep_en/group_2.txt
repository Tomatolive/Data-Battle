acquiring EP2 clearly failed to correctly determine its validity. The conclusion that the
client should purchase EPI with minimum delay, effect the assignment so that a
divisional application based on the full original text of EPI could be filed as soon as
possible was not mentioned by many candidates. Very few candidates discussed the
patent rights situation for the flap technology in the USA, even though it was explicitly
mentioned in the paper that the client had strong interests there
The analysis of the situation for the third question (dimples and equivalent knobs) was
correctly made by many candidates but, again, the consequences for the client were not
seen by all such candidates. Many candidates appeared to know that a disclosure of an
invention on the same day as filing a patent application thereon was not prior art but did
not clearly explain this. Similarly, most knew that patent applications filed on the same
day were not prior art against each other but did not explain this and the consequences
for each applicant. The issue of whether Mr Cervantes was really the inventor of EP4
was missed by many. The better candidates dealt with the aspect of equivalence of
dimples and knobs and saw that cross licensing between the client and DQWE was the
logical solution to the conflict.
No specific comments can be made with respect to the foulth question.
It is pointed out that the submission of pre-prepared materials as part of the answer
paper is contrary to the Regulations (see "Instructions to candidates concerning the
conduct of the examination", paragraphs 4. and 57, published in Supplement to Official
Journal 12/2004). Such materials will be disregarded for marking.
