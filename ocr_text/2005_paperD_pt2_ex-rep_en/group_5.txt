can be filed. It could be tried to bring the seven pages relating to the flap
technology into EPI before grant, Arts 14(2) last sentence, 70(2) or R 88 EPC
With the above-mentioned steps effected, your company (MÖWE) cannot be
barred by DQWE from exploiting the flap technology in Europe. DQWE would be
barred from exploiting the flap technology in Europe, in particular to produce in
Spain, by the divisional application to be filed by your company (MÖWEY Since
no rights exist for the flap technology in USA both MOWE and DQWE are free to
use such flaps there.
As to your third question.
The applications EP3 and EP4 were both filed by fax in accordance with R 36(5)
EPC, OJ 1992, 299, 2 and GL A-II, 1_1.1 establishing 0407.02 as the valid
date of filing.
The displayed wing with dimples is not prior art under Art 54(2) EPC against EP3
and EP4 since this disclosure was only made on the very same day as the filing
took place.
The EPO only counts in full days with respect to establishing the date of filing
and different filing times on the same day will get the same filing date, Art 120
and R 83 EPC Applications EP3 and EP4 are not prior art against each other
under Art 54(3) EPC, since they have the same date of filing.
Therefore, valid patent protection can be obtained for the dimples by both EP3
and EP4. It strongly appears from the facts and circumstances that ML
Cervantes is neither the true inventor nor successor in title for the dimples part of
EP4 and thus he is not entitled to the grant of a European patent, Art 60 EPC
You (MÖWE) should consider the possbility of initiating national proceedings
and proceed in accordance with Art 61 EPC, GL A-IV 2 and GL C-VI 9.23 and
subsequently file a request for suspension under R 13 EPC_
Conceming the protrusions pan of EP4, it should be noted that it depends on
national law in Spain who would be recognized as the true inventor, since
protrusions were not shown on the wing. Therefore, patent protection for the
protrusions according to EP4 may go to DQWE
In any case, you are potentially in a position to forbid exploitation of dimples in
Europe.
On the other hand, even if losing the dimples part of EP4, DQWE may be in a
position to forbid exploitation of protrusions in Europe.
Depending on national law, it is possible that applications EP3 and EP4 each will
result in rights protecting both protrusions and dimples since these could be seen
as equivalents
In these not fully predictable circumstances, cross licensing of the rights of EP3
and EP4 in Europe could be a solution, since both parties might be held to
infringe the rights of the other
As to the fourth question:
