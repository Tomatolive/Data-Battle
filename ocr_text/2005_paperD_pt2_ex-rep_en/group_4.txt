time it is too late to file a US application based on EPI, since the grace period
has expired.
Despite Mr. Cervantes' rights resulting from PCTI on wings having foamed cores
of recycled scrap plastic, his company (DQWE) cannot freely exploit this
technology in Europe, since it would fall under the broader claims of EPI_ It is
therefore strongly advisable for you to purchase EPI to establish a situation
where DQWE infringes rights held by your company. This would also positively
exclude any infringement problems with EPI resulting from the broken wing
incident in Germany EPI should be validated in Spain as soon as possible to be
able to attack DQWE there
Cross licensing of the rights of PCTI and EPI in Europe would then appear to be
a reasonable strategy for the meeting with Mr. Cen.'antes, since both companies
infringe the rights of the other. At the same time, you (MÖWE) should try to
obtain a license of the US patent of PCTI, in particular in view of the Californian
tender
Concerning your second question:
The adjustable flaps were initially filed in EP2 on the 2004.2002, however, the
date of filing was re-dated on request by Mr. Vinge to 25.05_2002 when filing the
originally missing drawings, Art 91 91(6), R 43 EPC or GL. A-III-Iff
Therefore, the effective filing date for EP2 is 25.05_2002_ The disclosure of the
adjustable flap technology to you on 1505.2002 was prior to the effective date of
filing for EP2, but was under secrecy agreement and consequently will not be
relevant as prior art. The wing with flaps shown at the wedding is also not
relevant, since the disclosure was after the date of filing.
However, the disclosure of adjustable flaps from the description of EP2 as
included in EPI when filed on 20042002 is prior art under Art 54(3) EPC, since
EPI was filed before and published after the re-dated filing date of EP2 This
applies even though the subject-matter in question was not included in the
translation and consequently also not published, Art 70(2) EPC, GL A-VIII, 5.2 or
C-IV, 6.1. EP2 was granted on 0208.2004 and can be successfully opposed in
its entirety for lack of novelty based on EPI until 02052005.
Therefore, do not buy EP2
EPI as originally filed contains a full and enabling seven pages disclosure of the
flap technology. Hence, it would be possible to obtan separate protection for this
technology by filing a divisional application as soon as possible, since EPI will
only be pending until early April, R 25(1) EPC_ Even though the flap technology
was neither part of the translation nor published in EPI , filing a divisional would
still be possible, since the content of a European application is ultimately
determined by the original text of the application (in this case Danish), Arts 70(2),
76(1), 123(2) EPC and GL c-VI, or A-VIII, 5.2
Therefore, EPI should be purchased now
An assignment signed by both ML Vinge and you must be effected and recorded
at the EPO immediately in accordance with Arts 72 and R 20 EPC and GL E-XIII,
1 _ Thereafter, a divisional application with your company (MÖWE) as applicant
