Possible Solution Dll 2005
Dear Mr. MÃ¶ller,
In reply to your recent letter, please be advised as follows-
As to your first question:
Mr. Vinge's application EPI is the first filing for the foamed core technology and
is validly filed on Since no relevant prior aft is available, patent
protection can be obtained in Europe for a process of manufacturing wings and
the resulting wings having foamed plastic cores and an outer hard shell.
Mr. Cervantes' application PCTI was validly filed and claims a process of
manufacturing wings and the resulting wings with foamed cores of recycled scrap
plastic No pertinent prior art concerning PCTI appears to be available:
- since EPI was only published later, Art 54(2) EPC,
- since EPI , though filed earlier, cannot successfully be used as Art 54(3) EPC
document because it does not mention recycled scrap material,
- since the foam core of recycled material of the wing displayed at the wedding
was invisible and thus unavailable to the public, see e.g. GL D-V, 31.3_1 or
GI/92,
- since Mr. Vinge cannot be identified as a source of disclosure of the foam core
technology to Mr Cervantes at the wedding,
- since the disclosure of foam core technology to you by Mr. Mnge in May 2002
was under secrecy agreement
Therefore, Mr. Cervantes would appear to have rights resulting from PCTI in EP
and US
However, Mr. Cervantes may be faced with problems of true inventorship before
the USPTO/EPO, perhaps having partly based PCTI on technology invented by
Mr. Vinge.
The broken wing incident in Germany represents a possible infringement of
provisional protection resulting from the published PCTI and Mr. Cervantes may
take action against you in accordance with Arts 67 and 150(3) EPC Any action
against you is however only possible from the date when PCTI was properly
regionalized and translated. The broken wing incident in Germany may also
represent an infringement of provisional protection resulting from the published
EPI under Art 67 EPC Your company MOWE, could try to argue right of
continued use, however, such a right would in any circumstances be limited and
also would depend on national law.
Any exploitation by you in the USA of wings with foamed cores of recycled scrap
plastic will clearly infringe the US patent from DQWEs PCTI and may incur
heavy damages. Counterattacks could be based on the inventorship issue.
DQWE is infringing the general foamed core technology claims of EPI by
manufacturing and selling wings in Europe. In the USA DQWE is free to act,
since no rights apan from their patent resulting from PCTI exist there. At this
