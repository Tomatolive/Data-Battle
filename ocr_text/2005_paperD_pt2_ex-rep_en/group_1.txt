Examiners' Report - Paper D - Part II
Most candidates correctly assessed the relationship between the patent documents.
However, many failed to outline in appropriate depth the relevance of the non-patent
disclosures. It is noted that a small number of candidates believes that a granted patent
gives a positive right to make use of the claimed subject-matter.
The first three questions in the paper asked for an analysis of the patent situation and
asked how the client could improve upon his position; it was therefore necessary to
analyse the rights and the effect those rights would have on the client's business
activities. Many candidates focussed on the analysis of the patent situation and
neglected to clearly advise the client In some cases many pages were filled with
detailed advice on formalities and fee payments to be taken care of at some time in the
future and little attention was paid to acts that needed to be carried out urgently. The
conclusion seems to be that many candidates either do not have experience of giving
practical advice to clients or simply failed to read the questions to determine what the
client (examiner) was looking for
With regard to the first question (foamed core technology and the use of recycled
material), most candidates realised that the client, MÃ–WE, cannot use the economically
important recycled plastic material without a license from the competitor, DQWE Most
recognised that DQWE needed a license under EPI but not all came to the conclusion
that their client should be strongly advised to take up the offer of acquiring EPI from Mr
Vinge_ Those candidates who advised their client to acquire EPI then correctly
determined that a cross license with DQWE under which DQWE obtained a license
under EPI in exchange for the client's license under PCTI was the logical conclusion.
In order to answer the second question (flap technology) it was necessary to realise that,
because the disclosure of EPI, as originally filed, included the text of the description of
EP2 albeit without the "supelfluous" drawings, EPI was prior art under Article 54(3)
against the re-dated and therefore later filed EP2_ Filing a divisional application was not
necessary to obtain this prior art effect Those that realised that EP2 lacked novelty over
EPI generally also realised that opposition against the European patent was possible
but that the opposition period would soon expire. Those candidates that recommended
