Many candidates realised that the encyclopaedia was not part of the state of
the art, but could be used as proof of common general knowledge. They
recognised that the only reasonable attack against EP-CART was based on
lack of inventive step. Not all of those candidates, however, provided an

consent of Watergate. Raised by Membrain as intervener, it would be
admitted without this restriction.
