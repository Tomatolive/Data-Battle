Examiners' Report Paper D 2012 - Part II
The Dll paper requires candidates to analyse a situation conceming various
existing patent rights and suggest specific actions that are usually to be
camed out within a time limit Care should be taken to correctly calculate the
time limits.
This year the main aspects of the paper were.
the priority claim for claim 1 of EP-2 was invalid since it was directed to a
generalisation not directly and unambiguously derivable from EP-I ;
claim 2 of EP-2, claiming validly the priority from EP-I , was novelty
destroying for claim 1 of EP-WG;
the interview with the examiner set for the following day indicated that the
international preliminary examination report (IPER) of PCT-I had not been
issued yet despite the expiration of the 31 month time limit; consequently
the submissions of Membrain were not yet publicly available so that a new
application based on them could still be filed;
the time limit for PCT-I to enter the European regional phase had been
missed but it was still possible to enter through the fufther processing
procedure;
it was possible to attack EP-CART for lack of inventive step by having
Dialab appeal the decision of the opposition division and by Membrain
intervening in the pending opposition-appeal proceedings;
the encyclopaedia could be used as proof of common general knowledge
despite the fact that it was published on the filing date of EP-CART and
was not itself part of the state of the art
Regarding the specific questions:
Question 1
Most candidates realised that PCT-I and EP-2 fulfilled the formal
requirements for claiming priority from EP-I : identity of applicant and filing
wthin the priority period. They also realised that claim 1 of EP-2 could not
benefit from the priority of EP-I since it was not directed to the same invention
as EP-I _ The consequence that this claim was lacking novelty over the
website posting by Watergate was also recognised by many candidates.
A lot of candidates correctly stated that claim 2 of EPO enjoyed the priority of
EP-I and was novelty destroying for claim 1 of EP-WG_
