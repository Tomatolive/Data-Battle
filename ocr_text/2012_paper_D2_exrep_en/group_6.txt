emerging countries using the rights conferred by national patents based on

Negotiate a cross-license agreement that may include: Membrain can
produce modules made of P in Europe and Watergate can produce modules
comprising the nozzle N in Europe.
Neither Watergate nor Membrain will have protection for the modules using
cheaper nozzles available on the market together with membranes without the
coating K, thus, Membrain can produce/sell those modules, but cannot
prevent Watergate from doing the same.
Answer to question 4
The decision of the opposition division is still open to appeal, as the two-
months time limit runs from notification of the written decision. The time limit
for filing the appeal is The time limit for filing the statement of
grounds is 9.072012.
The Encyclopaedia was published on the filing date of EP-CART, and thus is
not prior art itself. However, a teaching doesn't become common general
knowledge because it is published in a textbook but rather is included therein
because it was common general knowledge before the date of publication of
the book. The Encyclopaedia reflects common general knowledge; thus the
Encyclopaedia may be used as evidence to show that it was common general
knowledge before the filing date to use compound R for pore size control.
The subject-matter of claim 1 thus lacks an inventive step over the
combination of Dl and common general knowledge since there is no
unexpected technical effect
Lack of inventive step is a fresh ground of opposition.
If Dialab appeals, Membrain may intervene as an assumed infringer even at
the appeal stage. The time limit for intervention is 3 months from institution of
the infringement proceedings against Membraim i.e. 7.052012. In order to
keep the proceedings running Dialab must file a notice of appeal: pay the
appeal fee and file reasons in due course.
In appeal proceedings a fresh ground of opposition by the opponent-appellant
Will be examined only if the patentee agrees _ Thus, if Dialab themselves raise
the fresh ground of inventive step, Watergate must agree to the examination
of this ground of opposition In contrast, if Membrain intervene in the appeal
proceedings, they may raise this fresh ground without the consent of
Watergate.
