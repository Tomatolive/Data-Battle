Possible solution - Paper D 2012 - Part II
Answer to question 1
EP-I was validly filed as no claims are needed for accordance of a filing date.
EP-I is the first filing for a membrane module comprising the special nozzle N
and the combination of ceramic membranes C and the nozzle made of
stainless steel.
EP-2 was filed within the priority period, 31.7_2010 extended to 2.089010
Priority can be claimed from EP-I as the subsequent fate of the application is
irrelevant. The priority is not valid for claim 1 in EP-2 as it is directed to a
generalisation not derivable from EP-I, i.e. not to the same invention. The
handbook is prior art under Art 54(2) EPC for claim 1 of EP-2_ The website
posting is prior aft under Art. 54(2) EPC for claim 1 of EP-2. The disclosure on
the website destroys novelty of the subject-matter of claim 1 of EP-2
The priority is valid for claim 2 of EP-2 as it is directed to the specific
combination of ceramic membranes and the nozzle made of stainless steel
disclosed in EP-I _ Claim 2 of EP-2 is novel and inventive.
PCT-I validly claims priority from EP-I as it was filed within the priority period
and the claim of PCT-I is unambiguously and directly derivable from the
general part of EP-I. The subject-matter of the sole claim of PCT-I is novel
and inventive
US-WG is the first filing for a module with nozzle N and a bundle of fibres
made of polymer P and there is no relevant prior art EP-WG validly claims
priority as it was filed within the priority period, i.e. 30.42011 extended to
252011, and directed to the same subject-matter as US-WG due to filing by
reference. As EP-WG was published and its priority is valid, EP-WG is 54(3)
EPC prior art for claim 1 of EP-2_ The subject-matter of claim 2 of EP-2 is
54(3) EPC prior art against the subject-matter of claim 1 of EP-WG because
claim 2 of EP-2 validly claims priority from EP-I. The subject-matter of claim 1
of EP-WG is not novel in view of claim 2 of EP-2_
The demand for PCT-I was validly filed as the time limit is the transmittal of
ISR plus 3 months.
There is sufficient evidence before the examiner that a module also works
with other materials than ceramic fibres; the objection as to the missing
essential feature is likely to be dropped resulting in a positive IPER
The time limit of 30 months for entering the US national phase with PCT-I has
lapsed.
