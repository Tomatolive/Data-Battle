Most of the candidates stated that the normal time limit for PCT-I to enter the
European regional phase had expired. Not all of them, however, commented
on the missed tme limit to enter the US national phase.
Few candidates recognised that the objection for missing essential features in
the claim of PCT-I would be very likely dropped.
Question 2
A lot of candidates suggested that Membrain should file a new application
related to the subject matter described in the reply submitted for PCT-I
Not all of those were familiar with the fact that the international preliminary
examination (IPE) is confidential until the issue of the IPER and the
submissions made by Membrain were not immediately made available to the
public. Fewer candidates reached the conclusion that, since Membrain had an
interview with the examiner set for the following day, the IPE had not finished
yet and the file had not been made accessible to the public by the EPO
Those candidates suggested that the new application should ideally be filed at
the latest on the day of the interview since the IPER could be issued any
moment thereafter.
Few candidates elaborated on the eventual geographic coverage and the
possible clams of the new application.
Question 3
Most of the candidates recognised that it was still possible to enter the
European regional phase of PCT-I by requesting further processing. Very few
candidates, however, stated that this can be done even before the notification
of loss rights is issued by the EPO
Very few candidates suggested that Membrain should file third party
observations /opposition based on Euro-PCT 1 and/or EP-2 against EP WG in
order to invalidate its first claim.
Many candidates provided an analysis of what scope of protection Membrain
and Watergate would obtain after the suggested actions were carried out Not
all of them, however, drew conclusions about how the resulting rights could be
used by Membrain and Watergate to prevent each other from exploiting their
inventions. Some candidates suggested reasonable licensing agreements
Question 4
Most of the candidates recognised that the correct way to respond to the
infringement proceedings instituted against Membrain was to have Dialab
appeal the decision of the opposition division so as to give to Membrain the
opportunity to intervene as assumed infringer With respect to filing the
appeal, most of the candidates stated the required actions. Regarding the
intervention procedure, however, insufficient details were given by most of the
candidates.
