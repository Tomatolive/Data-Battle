Answer to question 2
The evidence submitted to the EPO and concerning the revolutionary
membranes comprising the coating is NOT yet made available to the public
due to the confidential nature of the IPE The EPO allows access to the IPE
files once IPER has been established. IPER has not been established as the
interview with the examiner has not been held yet
File a new application directed to the revolutionary membranes at the latest
tomorrow, i.e. the date of the interview The new application should be (a) a
PCT application, (b) a priority filing for a subsequent PCT application in order
to cover the relevant markets including the emerging countries or (c) national
filings for those countries. This time, ensure you seek protection in the US in
order to obtain patent rights that would prevent Watergate from manufacturing
in the US. The claims in the new application(s) should be directed to a
membrane fibre made of polymer P and comprising the coating K. Include
also dependent claims e.g. directed to a bundle of those membranes, bundle
plus means for injecting air into the bundle.
Answer to question 3
Time limit for entering the EP-phase with PCT-I lapsed on 2002.2012.
However, fulther processing is still possible. Fufther processing can be
requested even before receiving notification of the loss of rights.
Request fulther processing by paying the fees and complete the omitted acts,
i.e. all steps necessary to enter the regional phase.
Once the filing fee has been paid for PCT-I (Euro-)PCT-I will be Art 54(3)
EPC prior art against clam 1 of EP-WG.
File third party observations or an opposition against EP-WG pointing to Euro-
PCT-I and/or EP-2
Watergate will be able to obtain a European patent based on claim 2 of
EP-WG
Provided that the national requirements are met, Watergate may clam
compensation from Membrain based on provisional protection conferred by
EP-WG as Membrain are manufacturing the modules in Austria.
In tum, Membrain might be able to claim compensation based on provisional
protection conferred by PCT-I
Watergate will have patent rights to the modules using polymer P membranes
enabling them to prevent Membrain from exploiting modules comprising the
membranes made of P, with or without the coating with K. Membran will be
able to prevent Watergate from exploiting Watergate's modules using
membranes made of P and comprising the nozzle N in Europe and in the
-5
