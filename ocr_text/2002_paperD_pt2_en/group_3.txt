pending. On 27 November 2001 and each claiming the corresponding priority, the following
applications were filed: applications MULTISAW-EP and COOLMIX-EP at the EPO, both
designating all contracting states; applications MULTISAW-US and COOLMIX-US in the
US and applications MULTISAW-JP and COOLMIX-JP in Japan. Dr Zornig had intended
the content of these MULTISAW applications to be the same as that of the respective
priority application. Only in the case of application COOLMIX-EP further embodiments
were described wherein COOLMIX was mixed with several types Of surfactants. It should
be noted that no reference to the MULTISAW process is made in the COOLMIX
applications. We have also found no indication in our files that an official communication or
a search report was issued on any of the above mentioned applications.
While checking our internal files we noted that Dr Zomig made a mistake when
MULTISAW-EP and COOLMIX-EP were filed. In both cases, the application documents
contained a request for grant Of a patent which was correctly filled in. In the case Of
COOLMIX-EP, the correct claims, description and drawings were filed. Unfortunately, the
claims, description and drawings pertaining to COOLMIX-EP were erroneously also filed in
the case of MULTISAW-EP instead of the correct claims, description and drawings. The
respective priority data were correctly filled in, in both cases, but apparently no priority
documents were filed at the filing date, since the certified copies Of MULTISAW-DE and
COOLMIX-DE are still in our intemal files. We hope that, having the correct priority
document for MULTISAW-EP in Our hands, we will be able to prove what we had in fact
intended to file, so that we can continue the case as intended. Contrary to the EP cases, the
correct application documents and the certified copies of MULTISAW-DE and COOLMIX-DE
were duly filed in the corresponding US and JP cases
Some Of Our conventional sawing devices are manufactured by the Japanese company
NIPPON SAWS KK. They have recently informed us that they have filed, on 2 October 2000,
an intemational patent application CLEAN-PCT as a first filing in Japanese at the Japanese
Patent Office, designating all contracting states. This application concerns the cleaning Of used
saw blades. It discloses, amongst others, a mixture of a composition identical to COOLMIX
with a surfactant which was not described in our COOLMIX-EP. We are now worried since
we have recently realised that mixtures Of COOLMIX with any surfactant are not only very
