You are a European patent attorney and have today had a meeting with Dr Wichtig,
managing director of your new client SILWAFE AG, Munich, DE, which you validly represent
in proceedings before the EPO Dr Wichtig has informed you about the following facts:
"SILWAFE AG is a supplier of silicon wafers to the electronic industry. These wafers are thin
discs of about 0.5 mm thickness and 15 or 20 cm diameter. In our factory, they are produced
by sawing from monocrystalline silicon rods. My company's R&D department is in charge Of
developing and improving the sawing processes we use; however, we do not ourselves
manufacture the sawing devices for use in production, but have them made by external
engmeenng companies.
The patent affairs Of my company have, in the past, been entrusted to our employee Dr
Zornig. At the end of last month, I informed him that his job was to be taken over by an
external patent attorney from 2003 on, for reasons Of rationalization. Dr Zornig was furious.
He immediately left his work place and will no longer be available to do any work for the
company. Since Dr Zornig left us, all we have been able to do is to carry Out a stock-taking Of
the present situation, with the following result:
During the last few years, Our department has been developing a new sawing process
MULTISAW, in which the silicon rods are not cut by a single saw blade as in the state-of-the-
art processes, but simultaneously with a plurality Of parallel saw blades. Thus we obtain,
instead of only one wafer per sawing step, several wafers at the same time. This process will
revolutionize the sawing technology in the field of wafer sawing and will, as we hope, give us
a considerable advantage over Our competitors. We have also developed a new cooling
composition COOLMIX which turned out to be especially suitable for this process. This
composition is sprayed into the sawing gap during the sawing, for removal Of heat and
abraded material.
Dr Zornig had on 29 November 2000 and in the name Of SILWAFE AG filed an application
MULTISAW-DE claiming and describing the sawing process and the device for carrying
out the process, and an application COOLMIX-DE claiming and describing the cooling
composition, at the German Patent and Trademark Office. Both applications are still
