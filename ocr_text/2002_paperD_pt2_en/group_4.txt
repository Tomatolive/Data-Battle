efficient in cooling, but also have excellent properties in subsequently cleaning the sawn wafers.
Therefore, we believe that mixtures Of COOLMIX with any surfactant should be protected by
us. We are highly interested in such protection, but in EPC contracting states only.
Mr Klug from our department informed me earlier today that he and a colleague have
been developing, since the beginning of this year, an improved MULTISAW-process. In this
embodiment BLOWSAW, a computer control unit compares the actual saw blade positions
during sawing with the desired, ideal positions, and regulates the intensity of a stream of air
laterally blown towards the saw blades by a system Of nozzles, to compensate for deviations
from the desired cutting line. The BLOWSAW technique has given surprisingly good results in
Our tests. By the way, the computer program controlling the process was developed by a student
during a period Of practical training in Mr Klug's group in our company. The student had signed
an employment agreement which gives us all rights for inventions developed during the course
ofthe employment. He has meanwhile left Our company and the university for a job in a Silicon
Valley computer company, and has moved to the United States with unknown address.
On 6 December 2000, shortly after the filing of MULTISAW-DE and COOLMIX-DE,
Mr Klug, the inventor, had been visiting the Swiss engineering company Z채hnli AG. We
have a long and successful working relationship with this company; they have for
instance fabricated a number of the sawing machines we presently use in our production
process. In the meeting, Mr Klug presented the MULTISAW-process, but did not mention
the COOLMIX composition. He handed over documents marked "confidential" including a
description of the process and sketches of the sawing machines. He asked Ing. Listig,
head Of the development Of Z채hnli AG, whether Z채hnli AG would be able to produce such
a machine. Ing. Listig replied that this task was highly interesting for his company in view
Of the possibility Of worldwide commercialisation Of the sawing machines. Mr Klug stated
that such a worldwide commercialisation would only benefit our competitors and was not
in the interest of SILWAFE AG. On 10 January 2001 Z채hnli AG had given their written
agreement for producing the machines for us and since January this year we have been
testing three of the new sawing machines produced by them and we intend to start
commercial use of the new process in October.
