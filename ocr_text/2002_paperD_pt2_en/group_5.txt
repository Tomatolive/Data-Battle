Last week I met Dr Bissig, the managing director of Zähnli AG at the semiconductor fair
SEMITEC 2002, where he told me that one Of his employees, Ing. Listig, had invented a new
sawing process. Zähnli AG had filed an international patent application CUT-PCT for this
process as a first filing with the International Bureau on 20 December 2000 for EP, JP and
US. Dr Bissig provided me with a copy of the text Of the application since he believed the
process — which is still a trade secret — might be of interest to our company. The text has
meanwhile been carefully reviewed by Mr Klug. The process according to CUT-PCT appeared
to him to be very similar to our MULTISAW-process. When we checked our files, we noted
that part of the description of CUT-PCT is almost a word-for-word copy of the documents we
had handed over at the first meeting. Some Of the drawings, too, are only fair copies Of the
sketches we had handed over. There are claims to a multiple blade sawing process and to
multiple blade sawing machines which are drafted in such a general way that they cover our
MULTISAW process and device. However, CUT-PCT also contains a description and claims
for a special type of saw blade unknown to us, for use in a multiple blade sawing process.
In my opinion, the way Ing. Listig of Zähnli AG has acted is very annoying, when you
consider the long and good business relations between Our companies. Therefore, I have
arranged a meeting with Dr Bissig on Wednesday next week in order to clarify the situation.
Personally, I would strive to maintain good business relations. However, I do not know if this
is achievable and therefore want to be prepared for all possibilities.
In preparation Of this meeting, I would like you to report in writing and as soon as
possible on
2.

your assessment Of the patent situation conceming the above applications;
what options we have, and how we should proceed with Zähnli AG concerning
our MULTISAW-invention; and
what steps you would take in order to protect our interests."
