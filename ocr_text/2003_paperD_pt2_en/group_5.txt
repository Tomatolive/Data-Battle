At the end of the priority period, we were convinced of the commercial interest in S2, but
we were sceptical concerning Sl. Therefore, we filed on 01 _ 10.2001, also as joint
applicants, a PCT application PCTI (in order to postpone costs) and a European patent
application EP4 both claiming priority of ESI. EP4 describes and claims only S2, and
PCTI describes and claims only Sl The abstracts of EP4 and PCTI have the same
content as the abstract of ESI which describes both shielding systems.
We filed PCTI in Spanish including all possible designations, and paid the filing, search
and designation fees.
On 10.04_2002 PCTI and EP4 were each published with search report Although the
search report of PCTI indicated that the claimed subject matter was clearly patentable,
we decided that S2 was of more interest to us than Sl. Therefore, we have not taken
any action with respect to PCTI after its filing."
