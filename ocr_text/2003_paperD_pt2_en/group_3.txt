As we also need patent protection in Europe, we filed a European patent application
EPI with the EPO, designating all the contracting states and claming priority of US2_
We filed the following documents: description, claims, abstract, drawing, a designation of
inventor, a declaration of priority and a certified copy of US2, as well as a cheque for the
amount of the filing fee and the search fee. EPI was mailed to the EPO by a regular
registered letter on 29.10.2002 by national post services. The notice of receipt from the
EPO indicates that the documents of EPI were received by the EPO on 08.11 2002.
EPI describes and claims the same subject-matter as IJS2_ In addition, EPI describes
and clams a plug with contacts of pentagonal cross-section, because in the meantime
we found that such a pentagonal cross-section also extends product life. In fact our
developers found that the surprising effect of having product life extended for HVHF
plugs is achieved only if the plug contacts have a triangular, square or pentagonal cross-
section. We had a discussion on the unity of invention of EPI, but to us it was clear that
the claimed three alternative solutions are in fact equivalent solutions to the same
problem and are linked by the same inventive concept. Therefore we filed a single
application for these three solutions. As we do not know yet which one of the three
solutions is commercially the most promising, we would like to have patent protection for
all the three solutions. Last month we started advertising our plugs with contacts of
triangular or square cross-section.
We thought we were in a good position, until last week, when we received a warning
letter from our French competitor LBP (for "La Bonne Prise"). Therein they informed us
that their European patent EP2 discloses and claims HVHF plugs with contacts of
triangular or square cross-section. EP2 was granted for DE, ES FR and GB_
