You are a European patent attorney and today you receive the following letter from a
new client, the Dutch company "PP (for Plug & Pray), which you will represent in
proceedings before the EPO
"We are a manufacturer of high voltage, high frequency (HVHF) plugs. Our only markets
are Europe and the USA.
Over the last three years our R&D department has been developing a new generation of
HVHF plugs. Usually the contacts of these plugs have a circular cross-section. However
our developers found out that the product life can be extended significantly by using
contacts of triangular cross-section.
On 01.03_2001 , we filed a first patent application USI with the USPTO, because the
USA is the most important market for us and we are very sensitive with regard to patent
infringement lawsuits. USI describes and claims an HVHF plug with contacts of
triangular cross-section.
A few months later our developers discovered that contacts of square cross section also
extend product life in comparison to traditional plugs. Accordingly, on 01.112001 , we
filed a fufther US patent application IJS2 as a continuation-in-part (CIP) of USI. USI
was withdrawn shortly after the filing of US2 US2 describes and claims the same
subject-matter as USI. In addition IJS2 describes and claims a plug with contacts of
square cross-section. A US patent was granted in February 2003 for our US2 application
as filed.
