LBP sells products in USA and in DE, ES, FR and GB. In the past LBP has only filed
patent applications for these five countries. From the patent publication of EP2, which
was attached to the warning letter, we could see that the mention of the grant of EP2
was published on 06.112002 The letter further indicated that EP2 was granted without
a prior publication of the application and that the short time benveen filing and grant was
due to a request for accelerated prosecution. EP2 was filed on 14.112001 and claims
priority of FRI, a French patent application of LBP with a filing date of 06_06.2001. We
have made investigations and have found that FRI only describes and claims plugs with
contacts of triangular cross-section.
In order to resolve the situation quickly, we have a meeting at the end of next week with
LBP to discuss a possible settlement
We made some preparations for this meeting and we found that LBP filed another
European patent application EP3_ EP3 was filed without claiming any priority on
15.032001. EP3 discloses and claims a shielding system for HVHF plugs. DE, ES, FR
and GB were designated. The search repoll of EP3 was published on 2409.2002 and
contains only one reference, a German document, which is cited as an "A" document.
We made a file inspection of EP3 and we found that a first communication had been
issued in which it was indicated that grant would be possible if LBP were to amend the
application in order to overcome certain clarity objections.
Please note that we filed on 01 _ 10.2000, together with our Spanish subsidiary as joint
applicants, a Spanish patent application ESI , disclosing and claiming two shielding
systems for HVHF plugs. One of these two shielding systems, SIV corresponds exactly
to the one disclosed in EP3_ The second shielding system, S2, is completely different
On 15.01_2003, the Spanish Patent Office granted a patent for ESI without
amendments.
