The lack of sufficiency attack outlined above will be preferable to any attack of
lack of novelty and/or inventive step, e.g. made without withdrawing EPI
because:
(a) the public disclosure by KA at the 20/1/09 conference is not significant
because it did not contain enablinq disclosure of the signal;
(b) in any case, EPKM's disclosure of a combination of a fishing net and
transmitters is apparently novel and inventive itself.
It is noted that it will most likely not be possible to file new applications
(either KM or another party) to the fishing method or net/transmitter combination,
because KM have already publicly disclosed this subject-matter on their website
on 11/2/09.
For the avoidance of doubt that a combination of the general method of EP-KM
and KA's specific signal might still be found inventive if combined in a later
application, KA could themselves now simply publicly disclose their combination
(eg_ on their website, in their public libraiY, etc.) (It is noted that KA are not
interested in protection for the fishing method).
Finally it should be noted that it would not be advisable to withdraw EPI, but then
to add a priority claim to EPI in one of KA's later filings (e.g. in EP3)_ This is
because the publication of the later application would then still occur before
publication of EPKM (it being determined by the earliest priority date). Upon
publication of the later application, e.g. EP3, the text of EPI would immediately
become publicly available via the online file for the later application - hence
EPKM would be sufficiently disclosed.

As indicated above, EPI should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
EP2 contains apparently allowable claims to (1) the signal and (2) the filter, Fl
(In fact, if EPI was QQ! withdrawn, it would on publication become a European
prior right against EPI and so take away the novelty of claim (1) of EP2 â€” this will
not be a problem given that EPI is being wthdrawn).
Claim 3 of EP2, to the circuit Cl, is apparently insufficiently disclosed.
EP3i as corrected by filing the missing description pages, has a filing date of
2/2/10 and contains a sufficiently disclosed claim to Cl
However, this filing date is after the public disclosure of EP3 at the end of January
2010 in KA's public library. It is not relevant that "no one has consulted" EP3 so
far: this is still a disclosure under 54(2) because it has nonetheless been made
available to the public (see, e.g. Guidelines C-IV &1)_
All of the claims of EP3 would therefore lack novelty over the library disclosure (in
addition, EP2 will on publication become a European prior right against EP3,
destroying the novelty of clams to the signal and Fl).
KA should therefore reply to the EPO notification to withdraw the missing parts of
the description, i.e. pages 6 to g.
The deadline for doing this is:
Notification of 17/2/10 is deemed to be 27/2/10 (R126(2) EPC);
Time limit is therefore 27/2/10 + 1 month = 27/3/10 (R56(6) EPC).
It will still be necessary to include pages 6 to g as these seem to be essential for
disclosing Fl and thus the claimed combination FI+C containing the required
electrical connection.
Therefore, at the same time or later than withdrawing the pages 6 to 9 under
R56(6), the following action should be taken:
