You can achieve this objective as follows.
The fishing method disclosed in EPKM refers to EPI as part of the direct
disclosure of the invention.
The fishing method appears to be novel and inventive based on the Search
Opinion issued in September 2009.
However, there is a problem with sufficiency of disclosure under A83 EPC
because the structure of the electromagnetic signal is essential for carrying
out the invention.
EPKM discloses the signal structure only by reference to EPI
This reference would need to be replaced by expressly incorporating the
essential details of the signal structure into the description (Guidelines A-II
4.19,
However, the necessary reference can only be included if the reference
document, i.e. EPI, is either publicly available on the filing date of EPKM
(clearly here it was not) or it is both (a) available to the EPO on or before the
filing date of EPKM and (b) published on or before the date of publication of
EPKM (T737/go, Guidelines C-ll 419).
Presently, EPI has not been published as publication occurs approximately
18 months from the date of filing (A93(1) EPC), i.e. around 12/1/09 + 18m
12/7/10.
The sufficiency of EPKM will therefore depend on whether EPI publishes
before EPKM itself publishes (EPI already bang available to the EPO and
thus criterion (a) above being satisfied).
If no action is taken to prevent EPI publishing, it will do so before EPKM
because EPI was filed a month earlier than EPKM_ In that case, EPKM would
be sufficiently disclosed and, probably, allowable.
KA should therefore withdraw EPI as soon as possible to avoid it being
published. The withdrawal should be effected well in advance of the
completion of technical preparations for publication (5 weeks before
publication so early June 2010).
Once EPI is withdrawn, KA should monitor for publication of EPKM and then
consider (a) filing 3rd party observations to draw attention to the insufficiency
disclosure during pendency of the EPKM application and/or (b) filing an
opposition to EPKM when it grants based on lack of sufficiency, within the 9
month post-grant opposition period.
In this case, 3rd party submissions may initially seem to be the better option as
they are cheap, can be made anonymously and seem to have a high chance
of success. However, it is recommended instead to wait until EPKM grants
and then to file an opposition. The opposition should successfully prevent the
claim to the fishing method; moreover, EPKM would likely not be able to
amend the clams to instead cover the (apparently novel and inventive)
combination of net and transmitter, because this would extend the scope of
protection of the granted patent (A123(3) EPC)_
