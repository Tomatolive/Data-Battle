A claim on undennater camera containing Cl (as disclosed already

Yes _
EPF has been validated in NO because when EPF was filed in February 2008 NO
was an EPC member state and it is evident that validation occurred in all states.
EP4
EP4 was filed in May 2007, [e. before NO joined the EPC on 1/1/08.
EP4 has been published after, but has an earlier filing date (May 2007) than
EPP's priority date (October 2007). EP4 is therefore a European prior right
against EPF for novelty only
EPF was itself filed in Februan,' 2008, i.e. after ento,' into force of EPC 2000.
Therefore, A54(4) EPC 1973 does net apply (Dec Ad Council SEI OJ 2007 197,
OJ 2007 504). EP4 is thus a European prior right for all states designated in
EPP, including NO.
However, an opposition against EPF (or a national revocation action) based on
EP4 would fail, because EP4 discloses only nets made from the qeneric class G,
not nets made from the specific ("species") material M. The claims of EPF are
therefore novel over the disclosure of EP4_ EP4 cannot be used to invalidate
(It follows that EPF was granted despite the citation of EP4 for the same reason).
PCT-JU
PCT-JU was filed in May 2007 and so will designate NO (PCT member since
1/1/1980).
PCT-JU also has an earlier filing date May 2007, than EPF's priority date
(October 2007). PCT-JU therefore is capable of becominq a European prior right
against EPF for novelty only. (PCT-JU is not only prior art for novelty and
inventive step against EPF because it was published after EPPs priority date).
However, for PCT-JU to become such a prior art, it must be published in an
official EPO language (i.e. English, French or German) and the filing fee must be
paid, R165 EPC This can in practice only be achieved by validly entering the
European regional phase. The initial 31 -month deadline expired in December
2009.
The European regional phase can still be entered by fulfilling the acts of R159
and paying the necessary further processing fees within 2 months of notification
of the Communication of 4/1/10 deeming PCT-JU withdrawn, i.e. by
