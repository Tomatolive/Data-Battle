Therefore no further applications look possible.
PCT-JU
PCT-JU designates NO (all states designated and NO is a PCT-contracting
state).
However, it is not possible for the European regional phase application derived
from PCT-JU to designate NO because NO was not an EPC-contracting state
when PCT-JU was filed.
The only way protection could be obtained for NO would therefore have been by
entering the NO national phase directly.
The time limit for entering the national phase in NO was 31 months from the
priority date, May 2007 + 31m December 2009.
The period has thus expired.
According to PCT Applicant's Guide — NP Vol II — NO (referring to R49.6 PCT),
the national fee for entering the NO national phase must be paid by the 31 month
deadline. If not paid, this can only be excused by re-establishment of rights
requiring, inter alia, showing that the missed time limit was in spite of the
Applicant taking "all due care" in the circumstances. As failure to enter the NO
national phase was presumably deliberate (JU having lost interest in PCT-JU) it
seems unlikely that the conditions for re-establishment will be met.
It is therefore likely to be too late to obtain rights for NO from PCT.JU_
A specialist on NO patent practice should nonetheless be consulted as soon as
possible to check whether any options still exist for reviving PCT-JU in Noway.
