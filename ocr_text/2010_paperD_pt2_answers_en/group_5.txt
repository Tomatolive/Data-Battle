In principle, WA could get an assignment executed that transfers the rights in
PCT-JU fully to KA before entering the European regional phase However, in
practice such an assignment only takes effect at the EPO only on production of
appropriate evidence and after paying a fee (R22 EPC)_
Thus, in practice it will be much more convenient to deal with this after regional
phase ento,' has been effected.
As such, a professional representative (me) will be needed to complete the acts
for late entry into the regional phase. This is because JU are currently named as
an Applicant and, as a legal person not having a principal place of business in a
Contracting State, they are required to be represented in proceedings before the
EPO as designated office after the initial 31 month period for entry into the
national phase (A133(2) EPC, A27(7) PCT, How to get a European Patent Euro
PCT Part 2, S309)_
I can take the necessary steps myself without a separate authorisatiom (R 152
EPC; Dec Pres spec Ed 3 of OJ 2007, L 1).
These steps are:
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
supplying a translation of the international application
specifying the documents on which the European grant procedure is to be
paying the filing fee
paying the designation fee (assuming the ISR issued at least 6 months
previously)
paying the supplementary search fee
filing a request for examination â€” including paying the examination fee
(again assuming the ISR issued at least 6 months previously)
paying the renewal fee for the 3rd year.
For items (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f), the further processing fees must also be paid
(for (f) for both requesting examination and paying the examination feey For (g)
an additional fee (50%) is payable because the due date has been missed. As
the 4th year renewal fee will be due soon (End of May 2010) it would also make
sense to pay this now to avoid forgetting it later (we are within the 3-month
allowable pre-payment period).
Once entry into the EP regional phase has been completed, the EPO will publish
the translation of the application and the European prior right effect will come into
existence _
Normally the publication takes about 6-12 weeks. Unlike for direct European
applications there is no direct provision allowing for early publication, but I would
recommend filing, when completing the acts for entry' into the regional phase, an
informal request for prompt publication on the basis that it is relevant to an
opposition on another European patent (see below). Clearly, a careful watch
should be in place to ensure publication occurs in good time.
Once PCT-JU's translation has been published by the EPO, an opposition can be
filed against EPF based on lack of novelty over PCT.JU as a European prior right.
Unlike EP4, PCT-JU does specifically disclose in its description nets made of the
specific material M and it is therefore novelty-destroying for EPF. Note that the
whole content of PCT-JU is relevant, not just the clams.
