The opposition deadline is 9/9/09 (date of publication of mention of grant of EP4)
+ g months = 96/10 (Agg(l) EPC)_
PCT-JU is prejudicial to novelty for EPF for all states because EPF was filed after
enoy into force of EPC 2000 (see transitional provisions already discussed
above).
Further, once EPF is revoked, its effect is void ab initio (A68 EPC), i.e. NF will not
be required to pay any infringement costs.
Of course, NF could also use this ability to have EPF revoked as a bargaining tool
for reaching an agreement with SF instead of pursuing revocation. However, it
would be prudent at least to ensure now that PCT-JU is validly regional-phased
and available as a European prior right. NF could then, if desired, negotiate with
SF in advance of expiry of the opposition period, e.g. for (free) rights to use the
subject-matter of EPF in their territ01Y of interest (probably only NO) and
withdrawal of the infringement suit in exchange for not getting EPF revoked. This
could have advantages for both sides:
SF would maintain their EPF patent and it would at least be more difficult
for a third party to seek revocation throughout the national courts after
expiry of the opposition period.
NF would be able to continue their activities, but EPF would block other
parties from using this technology in the EP contracting states, includinq in
NO (where EPF is validated, but which EP4 does not designate and where
there could be problems national phasing PCT-JU â€” see below).
This puts NF in a strong negotiating position because SF clearly stand to
lose most be not co-operating.
Should an agreement be reached, but relations deteriorate after the
opposition period for EPF has expired, SF could still use the European
regional-phased PCT-JIJ to attack EPF in national revocation actions (it
appears action in just NO would suffice as both SF's and NF's activities
are focussed there). A national action in NO is also an option instead of an
opposition even in the absence of any negotiations.

Probably not
Although SF are Swedish, it appears that all of their activities are carried out in
Norvvav (i.e. making and using the nets made of M)
Therefore, patent protection in NO will be needed in order to use patent rights
against SF
EP4
EP4 was filed in May 2007 and so cannot have designated NO (which
joined the EPC only on 1/1/08). EP4 cannot therefore be used against SF
in respect of their activities in NO.
Other Applications?
There is no indication any national NO application was filed at the same
time as filing EP4 and PCT-JU.
The 12 month period for filing a new application (e.g. a NO national
application or an EP application filed after NO joined the EPC) claming
priority from EP4 and/or PCT.JU expired in May 2008.
