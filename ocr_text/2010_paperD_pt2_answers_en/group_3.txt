A priority claim to EP2 should be added (deadline for taking this
action is 1/3/09 + 16 months = Sat 1/7/10, R52(2), extended to
Monday 3/7/10, R134(1); however, it must be done at the latest at
the same time as taking step (2) below); and
A new request to incorporate pages 6 to g into EP3 bv reference
to EP2 should be made (deadline is 12/1/10 + 2 months = 12/3/10,
R56(3) EPC This request will involve filing a copy of EP2
(probably not strictly needed as EPO has a copy of EP2 already,
but advised in view of close deadline), and indicating where the
missing pages are found in EP2 (in this case, they correspond
directly to pages 6 to g of EP2Y
In view of the close deadline of 12/3/10, it is recommended to withdraw the
current pages 6 to g and to carry out steps (1) and (2) in a single letter.
Once priority has been validly claimed from EP2 and the missing pages duly
incorporated, EP3 will retain its original filing date, i.e. 12/1/10.
Accordingly, KA's subject-matter will be divided and in Europe as follows-
Electromagnetic Siqnal
Covered in EP2. This claim appears novel and inventive over the
20/1/09 conference and the EPKM Internet disclosure as these do not
have an enablinq disclosure of the actual signal structure. A similar point
applies in relation to novelty over EPKM itself as a prior right.
There is also no evident intervening disclosure of the signal before the
filing date of EP3_ EP3 also discloses the signal but priority cannot be
clamed back to EP2 for this subject-matter because the first application
was EPI and this was still pending when EP2 was filed. Nonetheless, to
save costs, KA could consider withdrawing EP2 before publication if the
risk of an intervening disclosure of the signal between 1/3/09 and 12/1/10
is considered to be very small.
If EP2 is not withdrawn before publication, it will destroy the novelty of
any claim in EP3 to the signal as a European prior right
Note that addition of a priority claim in EP3 to EPI, to establish an
effective date of 12/1/09, for the signal claim, is QQ! recommended in
view of the need to render EPKM insufficient â€” see Section 1 above for
more details.
Fl
First disclosed, and claimed, in EP2. It appears possible to prosecute
this subject-matter to grant in EP2 and also in EP3 since EP3 validly
clams priority of EP2. In this situation, there may be double patenting
issues at a national level post-grant. Alternatively, Fl could be deleted
from EP2 or EP3 (and clearly the situation is moot if EP2 is withdrawn as
proposed above).
First enabling disclosure is in EP3_ There is no indication that this claim
will not be allowable (EP2 even if maintained will not destroy novelty as a
