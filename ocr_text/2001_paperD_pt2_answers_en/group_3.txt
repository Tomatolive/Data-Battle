If no exam/designation fees are paid for NE:.EU2 it will be deemed withdrawn and cannot
lead to problems, If they are paid, then NF-EU2 could issue with a general claim to
"blottanes" which would indeed cause problems (although note there is problem with
support, they might not get such a broad claim allowed).
NF,EUL shares a priority date with B-EUI & B-EU2 Of — at least to some of its
matter: In particular, claims to the use of blottanes as moisture-absorbent materials are
entitled to priority and therefore not anticipated under Art. 54(3) by B-ELJ l. Such claims
could therefore be allowed and would be likely to cause you problems. •Illey would also
cause Pure Agrochemical problems in exploiting their compost as they would cover what
they are doing.
Note (and this applies to the patentability ofB-EU1 & EU2) — there is on
patents being granted to different applicants when the two have the same priority date
(GLX C-IV, 6.4). So material in NF-EUI that is entitled to priority cannot be cited
against B-EUI or B-EU2, and B-PCT cannot be cited against the material in NF-EUI that
is entitled to priority. So it is possible (if you can persuade the examiner to let you amend
B-F,U I ) for both you and Niffy to get valid patents claiming the use of blottanes as a
moisture absorbent material.
If Niffy do not pay designation fees for NF-EU2, then B-EU2 could be granted in its
present form and would form a valid patent. In order to enforce it, you need to file
translations in the designated states into their national languages (Art. 65(1 within
3 months. Once that is done then you can enforce the patents under national law where
necessary, including the filing of injunctions etc.
If Niffy do designation fees on NE-EtJ2, then you will need to amend the patent
to ensure it has a valid claim, If this cannot be done before grant (eg because the EPO
refuse amendments under R. 86(3), or even R. 86(4)), then you would end up with a
granted but only partially valid patent. You can probably amend after grant in most
countries, but this is an expensive procedure. If you try to sue Niffy within the next
9 months they would almost certainly oppose the patent (Art. 99) centrally on the grounds
that claim I is not new (Art. 54(3)) over NF-FU2. You would then get a chance during
opposition proceedings to amend the patent to ensure it is valid.
If you allowed to amend by the FPO, and they re-open examination, then you
have provisional protection after publication under Art. 67 EPC — the PCT publication
counts as a European publication (Art. 158(1) EPC). This does not allow you to open
proceedings before grant, but you have the power after grant to sue for damages incurred
between publication and grant, However you will need to file claims translations
(Art. 67(3) in each country you are interested in to start the provisional protection
running.
Disposut'le nappies containing X
A divisional cannot be filed having claims to disposable nappies containing X based on
B-EU2. A divisional application cannot extend beyond the subject matter of its parent
application (Art. 76(1) EPC). B-EU2 does not contain any disclosure Of product X or the
use of blottanes in disposable nappies. So a divisional based on B-EU2 cannot include
