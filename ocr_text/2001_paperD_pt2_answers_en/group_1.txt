NF-EU2 has the same description as NF-IE2 and priority (Art. 87 EPC) would therefore
seem to be validly claimed. We do not know of any disclosure of any of this subject
matter before the priority date ( I. 10.97) so it would appear that everything in NF-EU2 is
Blottanes in themselves seem to be inventive, so a claim to blottanes in general in
NF-EU2 should be patentable. Furthermore. since blottanes in general are described in
NF-EU2 NF-lE2), introducing such a claim is not prevented by Art. 123(2). The only
argument against this is that blottanes in general are described as being Of no practical use
so such a broad claim might be seen as not being supported by the description. The
process for making continuous fibres of blottanes is claimed, and is described as
"ingenious" so is presumably inventive.
Product A in the form of a woven textile is also already claimed, is new and is presumably
inventive, if nothing else for its antistatic properties. The use of A for antistatic properties
gives the possibility of a claim to A. No other uses of blottanes are described, or any other
blottanes mentioned.
To summarise, it seems possible that patentable claims in NF-EU2 could include:
Blottanes generally (possibly)
Product A
A in the forrn ofa woven textile, and
Process for making continuous fibres of blottanes
The fact that designation fees have not been paid may be significant. The designation fees
were due in February 2001 (6 months after search report (A 3 publication) was published
— Art. 79(2)). If they were not paid then, under R. 85a(l) or R. 85a(2) there is still a
possibility they could be paid with a surcharge.
If they are not, the application will be deemed withdrawn (Art. 91(4), Art. 79(3)).
Similarly the examination fee was due in 2.01 and does not seem to have been paid. If it is
not (under R. 85b, within 1 month of notification with surcharge) then. again, the
application will be deemed withdrawn (Art. 94(3)).
NF-EU I claims priority from NF-IEI. The two applications are identical so priority
would appear to be validly claimed. Hoyy_gygr, Art. ) states that priority can only be
claimed for a first application, and for at least some of the subject matter of NF-EUI ,
NF-IE2 is the first application rather than NF-IEL so priority cannot be claimed from
NF-IEI.
so NF-EU2 probably claim priority for

How to make blottanes as continuous fibres
Blottanes as woven textiles in shoe liners (NF-lE2 disclosed A which is a
blottane as a woven textile in shoe liners). Such claims will only have the
filing date of NF-EUI (1.6.99).
