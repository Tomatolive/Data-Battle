NF-EU2 probably claim priority for
Use Of blottanes as moisture absorbers
Moisture absorbent materials including blottanes
B-PCT, published after the filing date, but claiming valid priority from B-GBI, can act
as Art, 54(3) novelty only prior art against those claims entitled to priority, as all
designation fees were paid and although it was published aner filing date, B-GBI is
earlier (priority) date. This would knock out claims to blottanes in general — disclosed by
B-PCT. But claims to any of the rest of the subject matter would remain untouched.
NF-EU2 was also not published before priority or filing date of NF-EUI , but itself has an
earlier priority date even than the priority of NF-EUI. By the same arguments as the
claims not entitled to priority, it would anticipate (Art. 54(3)) all claimable subject matter
except the moisture absorbent properties of blottanes.
Neither NE-EU I nor NF-EU2 were published at the priority date (15.10.98) of B-EUI.
B-PCT was identical to B-GBI so priority may be validly claimed.
NE-EUI Shares the same priority (for some Of its matter) with B-EUI and can therefore
not be cited against it, even after publication. B-EU2 has the same priority as B-EUI
(Art. 76(1)) so NF-EUI cannot be cited against B-EU2 either. NE-EU I is not relevant
to the patentability Of B-EUI or B-EU2. NF-EU2 migm be citable under Art. 54(3) for
novelty only, but only if the designation fees are paid (R. 23a), and then only for those
states for which they were paid. Worst case scenario (from Boggy's point of view) is that
N does pay all designation fees and surcharges using R. 85a(l) or R. 85a(2), so NF-EU2
becomes citable.
It is relevant for novelty only (Art. 54 (3). Art, 56) though. The payment of designation
fees for NF-EU2 could knock out claims (in B-EUI ) to blottanes in general. It would not
knock out the claim to product* which is therefore patentable. In B-EU2, the subject
matter of GS2mmgssomaining.hlQttangs is not disclosed by NF-EU2 so claims to this
subject matter are patentable.
B-EUI is about to proceed to grant, following which it will be too late to amend to e.g.
textiles & papers of blottane, and the use Of blottanes as a moisture absorbent material
(which could be claimed — G 2/88). There does not seem to be an obvious way Of holding
up grant by non-payment Of fees — no renewal fees have fallen due. so write to EPO
requesting amendment to overcome this prior art.
The EPO does not have to accept the amendment (R. 86(3)), but equally it is possible
in exceptional cases (G 7/93) up until thc decision to grant is actually put in the EPO's
internal post (G 12/91). The EPO has to balance the applicant's interest in obtaining
a legally valid patent with the EPO's interest in bringing the procedure to a speedy
conclusion. Hard to call, because they might need to re-open examination to allow the
amendment (Art. 114(1)) & check if it is not anticipated by NF-EU2, which could
dissuade them. But worth a try because once it is being re-examined there will be a chance
to find out for good whether any/which designation fees are paid for NF-EU2.
