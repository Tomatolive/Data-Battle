[001] It is convenient to wash hands with liquid soap. FIG. 1 shows a cross section of
our liquid soap dispenser 100 containing liquid soap. It comprises a bottle 110 with a
threaded neck and a hand pump 120 which screws onto the opening of the bottle 110.
The hand pump 120 has a dispensing nozzle 130 and a tube 140 which extends towards
the base of the bottle 110. In order to prevent the tube 140 from being obstructed by the
base of the bottle 110, the length of the tube 140 is chosen so that it does not contact
the base of the bottle 110.
[002] As liquid soap we use an aqueous suspension comprising water, detergent and
suspended abrasive particles.
