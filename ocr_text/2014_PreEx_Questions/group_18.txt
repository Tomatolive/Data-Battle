[001] A problem with known liquid soap dispensers is that some of the product cannot be
removed from the base of the bottle. We have developed a liquid soap dispenser 200 as
shown in FIG. 1. The liquid soap dispenser 200 containing liquid soap comprises a
bottle 210, a hand pump 220, a dispensing nozzle 230 and a tube 240. The tube 240
extends down to the base of the bottle 210 such that the tube 240 is bent and the end of
the tube 240 extends along the base of the bottle 210.
