[001] We sell washing-up liquids in squeezable plastic bottles. FIG. 1 shows a bottle 310
containing a liquid with a base having a dome-shaped profile. This dome-shaped profile
of the bottle's base ensures a stable stand on a flat surface, even if the material the
bottle 310 is made of is very thin. The opening of the bottle 310 has a screw cap with a
nozzle 330 A tube 340 extends from the nozzle 330 inside the bottle 310.
[002] To remove the liquid, the bottle 310 is turned upside down and squeezed. A user is
able to control the amount of liquid squeezed out of the bottle 310. Since the neck of the
bottle is very narrow, nearly all the liquid can be removed in this way. When the
bottle 310 is almost empty it can be rinsed out with warm water to completely remove all
liquid from the bottle.
[003] The washing-up liquid comprises water, detergents and optionally perfumes and/or
colourants.
