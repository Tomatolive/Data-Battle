QUESTION 10
An applicant filed in January 2013 a European patent application EP-T relating to
invention X. The application EP-T includes several embodiments. The applicant now
realises that, although most of the embodiments are sufficiently disclosed, the
embodiment Xl lacks essential technical information and is therefore not sufficiently
disclosed.
For each of the statements 10.1 â€” 104, indicate on the answer sheet whether the
statement is true or false.
10.1
10.2
10.3
104
An objection of the examining division under Article 83 EPC regarding
embodiment Xl can be overcome by filing additional technical information.
If the examining division does not raise any objections under Article 83 EPC, lack
of sufficiency of disclosure will not be a valid ground for opposition against EP-T.
A valid option is to correct the technical information under Rule 139 EPC before
the publication of EP-T_
Before the publication of EP-T, it is not possible to amend the description of EP-T
in order to delete embodiment Xl .
