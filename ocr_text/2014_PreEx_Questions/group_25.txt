There is basis in the application as filed for amending claim Ill to exclude from the
scope of said claim compositions including non-ionic detergents.
It would be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC to replace the expression 'Water"
in claim Ill by the expression "aqueous suspension".
A claim reading: "Liquid soap composition consisting of water, detergent
and 20 to 25 percent by weight of glycerine based on the total weight of the liquid
soap composition." has a narrower scope than that of claim Ill.
It would be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC to exclude from the scope of
claim Ill compositions comprising 23 percent by weight of glycerine based on the
total weight of the liquid soap composition, to render the subject-matter of claim Ill
novel over a prior art document under Article 54(3) EPC disclosing a liquid soap
composition comprising water, detergent and 23 percent by weight of glycerine
based on the total weight of the liquid soap composition.
