It is vital that the earlier application be in force at
the date the divisional is filed. No renewals are due on
the earlier appln• unnil 31—1—94 (EPC Rule 37 (1)) a
request for substantive examination Should be Eiled
within 6 months Ot publication ot i ts search report
(EPC Art. 97 (2)) so as to keep the earlier application
pending .
when the search report is to bel has been
published; it is as well Co file a divisional before this
six month period expires, since then the earlier
application can be allowed, to expire by
not paying the examination fee. The earlier appl"
remains pending une il the end of this period whether the
exam fee is paid or not .
You cou Id keep the earlier appln• pending, & simply file
a new claim to the B. T by way of an amendment under EPC
Rule 86 (2) , allowable because the search report has
al ready been received. The amendrnenr. appears to be
supported by parts ot the original description, & hence
does not contravene EPC Art. 123 (2) (addition of subject
mat E er by amendment) .
On examinaeion by the EPO Examining Division (E. D.) , the
new claim would be Eound to Lack uni ty (EPC 82
Rule 30) with those al ready searched, since i t concerns a
difterene invention in a di Eterent technical tield and
with a different: use. The E.D. would then invite you to
file a divisional covering the new claim, so that i t
cou Id be eearched and exarnined in i ts ovn right. This
would delay the cose ot ti ling a divisional, bur- force
you to pay 2 exam. fees
- one on the divisional & one on
the earlier application. (NB, it is a moot point whether
the E.D. will examine a claim, not previously searched
bue supported by the original application, without the
fil ing Of a divisional — question recently reterred EO
the EBA.)
In view ot the points above, the safest option has to be to
file an EP divisional application covering the B.I.
specifically .
Filing a divisional now rather than later probably allows you
Co avoid paying an exam tee on the earlier application. It also
means the divisional will be examined sooner, which is Of use
