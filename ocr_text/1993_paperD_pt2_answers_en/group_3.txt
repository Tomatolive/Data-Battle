(30—1—92) but was published after C • s appln•'s "priority•

Iack novelty Over what iS disclosed in EP appin•
Claims are invalid. This applies with et tect tor all EPC
contrac•eing states designated in Ais appl"• .
C' s claims
Co the tool itselt, identical Co the egg beater disclosed
in A • s appln•, are invalid for Iack of novelty, as are
C' s claims to the use of the tool to pick up elongated
elernents (A' s disclosure ot spaghetti) by vertical -type
C could still obtain claims, in Such an EP appln• ,
to the
ua..e—Q.k the tool by rotating i t with its axis held
horizontal -
there ig support for this in C • s US patent &
hence, t assume, in the PCT appln• that tried Co claim
priori ty from Such use claims would be novel over the
Vertical —type use disclosed in A appln• . However,
wau Id be limited a use Of the tool which A maintains
does not work anyway. Thus, not only are Such claims Of
little corruruercial use, thev are also arguably invalid for
insufficienc"y• (EPC Art. e 3) because the ski Iled man could
not rnake the claimed invention work. Moreover, they would
be difficult to enforce — C would have sue his own
customers for using the tool in a particular way &
Chat they were doing so, or Sue others for selling the
tool and prove that the sales were Such as induce the
user to use the tool horizontal Iy (exact remedies depend
on national Law) .
NQt.e: the horizontal use is arguably disclosed in A 's
appln ,
tho• for a dit ferenE purpose
— un likely to
destroy novelEy Of C 's .
For the invention disclosed in A 's EP appln , A is
entitled t:o the grant of a European patent in preterence
to C, since A 's application has the earlier fil ing
(priority) date & has been Publi shed under EPC Art. 93
(EPC Art. 60 (2) & Art. 89) . This appli es for all states
designated in A 's EP appln• as published
(EPC Are. 60
Note C could also still obtain claims the use Of the
tool to pick up yarn, Since this appears to be novel over
A' s disclosures. Again, such use claims would be hard t'O
enforce.
The invalidity Of C • s priori ty claim, & Of certain of his
claims, Should be seen by the EPO if & when he proceeds
to the EPO regional phase. However, it does no harm to
file observations on Chese issues with the EPO under
