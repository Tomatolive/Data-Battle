Art. 115 (1) EPC. A can file such observations
anonyrnously. & does not thereby become a party to
proceedings before the EPO. The observations can only
taken into account by the EPO once regional processing Of
C • s application starts, but they can be fi led now (the
PCT publication on 6—8—92 takes the place Of European
publication (EPC Art. 158 , allowing observations to
be fi led afterwards) . When the EPO starts to examine C 's
appl"• ,
i t should cite Ais appln• against it
(EPC Art. 97 (1) & Art. 54 & require restriction of
C • s claims.
No need for A to stop marketing the B. r . in Europe, since
C does not appear to be entitled to protection tor the
tool in Europe and A, on the contrary, does. CAX..E
market with instructions for use in vertical orientation
— no risk of conflict with any claims C may assume
from what you say Of C 's marketing plans that he has not
yet made the tool public in Europe — had he done so prior
A 's priori ty date (31-1—91) he might be envi L led to
continue Buch use in certain countries, despite any
claims which A might be granted (rights depend on
national law) .
If C goes ahead & markets the tool in Europe, he risks
infringing claims which A may eventually be granted for
the B.I . A has provisional protection against Such use,
dating back to the EP publication date of 13—8-92 —
this
gi ves him the right to claim reasonable compensation tor
Cis activities falling within the scope of A 's claims.
However, A needs to file translations of his claims in
some countries to be sure Of his rights (EPC Art. 67 (3) )
- this depends on the national laws of the countries
concerned & appli es in those states which do not have
English (the publication language -
EPC Art. 14 (3) &
14 (6)) as an otficial language. The claims translations
can be sent C direct Iy Or fi led with, & pubLished by,
the national Patent Offices OE the relevant states — C
shouLd put this in hand for those European states in
which he has a cormercial interest .
patentability of the B.I. - should be patentable under
EPC law (EPC Art. 52) . It is industrially applicable & ,
so tar as we know from prior art Of which we are aware,
novel & inventive. Has advantages (see top of p. 2 of A' s
letter) to lend possible inventive Step over prior art .
