for the PCT application (PCT Art. 8 (2)
— conditions for
priority governed by Paris Convention) , unless the lat US
application was abandoned the 2nd one was fi led
(Paris Convenn•, Xrt. 'C TO give ri se to a
continuation application, XXX, XXX cannot have been
abandoned at the time the continuation application was
filed. Thug, the continuation application cannot give
rise to a priori ty claim for the PCT appln•, which was
fi led mre than 12 rnonths from the Ist application
(XXX, XXX) tor the tool. The PCT appln• ig only entieled
to its date of 30.1.92, and not to any
priority date.
The US patent published on 30-6-92 is not prior art
citable against the PCT application Or, in particular,
aga inst any EP appln• derived trom the Pœr — was
publi3hed too late (EPC Art. 54 .
You Say the PCT application designated all EPC
Contracting States. I assume thcy were designated with a
request Eor an EP patent, so that the PCT appln• may
later rise to an EP appln•. The advice below may

then on national law.
The priori ty claim from the Swedish appln• seems to be
valid — the EP appln• was fi led within 12 months of the
Swedish fi ling date (EPC Art. 87 You also Say there
were no Eorrnal deficiencies in the application. Thug, the
Ep appin• validly claims a priori ty date Of 31—1—91, for
all EPC contracting States .
There is adequate Support in the EP appln• for later
claims to the BRIGHT IDEA (B. 1.) because it is mentioned
in the description. B.I. is entitled to the 31—1-81
priori ty date because it is ment ioned in the Swedish
description (EPC Art. 88 (3) and especially (4) ) .
You Say you want to abandon your EP application.
do so until you have decided how to protect the B. 1. , eg.
by fil ing a valid divisional appln• (see later).
divisional can only bc fi led while the parent Ep appln•
is still pending (EPC Rule 25 .
Assuming C proceeds with his PCI' appln• into the European
regional phase, A' s EP appln• will be prior art citable
against C 's EP appln• under EPC Art. 54 It has an
earlier priority date (31—1—91) than that of C 's appl.n•
