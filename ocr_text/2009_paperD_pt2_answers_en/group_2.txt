PCT-BF cannot be available for I_S_ since not published. EPI would appear to be valid
(subject to the sufficiency query'). Therefore it is necessary to validate EPI in each of
the states of interest. Since Big Farma may be interested in the patent it is worth
validating in as many countries as you can afford, especially UK (your base) and Albania
(their base). Albania is an extension state for which extension may be obtained because
the extension fee was paid. Because of the London Agreement it will be possible to
validate the patent more cheaply than previously since many countries only require a
translation of the claims. No further translation required for FRI DE, Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, Monaco, Switzerland and the IJK_ Denmark, Croatia, Iceland, Latvia,
Netherlands, Sweden + Slovenia only require claims in their official language so long as
patent has been granted in a prescribed official EPO language (one of FR, DE or EN).
Since patent would have been granted in English, this applies to Croatia, DKI Iceland,
NL + Sweden only. Deadline for validation is 3m from grant in most countries, i.e. on 1
July 2009 (Wed) so needs to be done fairly soon. Get instructions for countries in
meeting.
EP2
EP2 validly claims priority from GBI because within priority period. 6 Jan 2007+ 12m
6 Jan 2008 (Sun) closed day —7 Jan 2008 (Mon) and claim has explicit basis in GBI
If PCT-BF enters the national phase it will be art 54(3) prior art for all cs. described
above and will anticipate the claim of EP2 since it discloses a method of coating at least
a part of the surface of plant pots with compositions comprising escargines.
EP2 has not yet been granted. Should respond to the 71 (3) communication requesting
amendment of the claims. At present includes escargines, slugbanite or both. Supply
amended claims referring to slugbanite or slugbanite and escargines
Supply amended claims in EN, FR and DE pay the fees for grant and printing. Respond
to the 71(3) communication within 4 months, i.e. another task required within 5 months.
At present don't know if this amendment is necessary, but very likely to be. If PCT-BF
does not enter national phase should still have time to file a divisional to cover the
escargines embodiment File divisional up to day before the mention of the Dec to Grant
for EP2 Could allow EP2 to grant as is and then limit after grant (if necessary) if you
wish.
EP3
If PCT-BF enters the national phase it will anticipate claim 1 of EP3 since is discloses
plant pots coated with escargines and EP3 has an effective date of 6 Jan 2007 for the
same reasons as EPI. PCT-BF would not anticipate cl 2 of EP3 since specific location
not disclosed. A plant pot coated with slugbanite or slugbanite + escargines would be
novel so should file a request for limitation of the patent and pay the fee. The request
for limitation should limit claim 1 to plant pots coated with slugbanite or slugbanite +
escarg•nes.
