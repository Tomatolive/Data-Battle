Claim 2 does need to be so limited. Make claim 2 independent so it includes escargine,
escargine + slugbanite or slugbanite applied in the specific location.
Such a request will still be accepted since narrower than the original claim set
If an opposition is filed the limitation procedure will be terminated and the fee refunded.
The patent also needs to be validated in those countries of interest
There is no time limit for filing the request for limitation. Might not want to wait to see
whether PCT-BF enters national phase before requesting limitation since might not be
necessary. Since EP3 has granted, need to validate within 3 months in most countries
as described in relation to EPI
The PCT application should have been filed within the convention period for GB2
3rd Jan 2008 + 12m = 3rd Jan 2009 (Sat) closed dayâ€” 5 Jan 2009 (Mon).
However, it is possible to file the application late with a request for restoration of the
priority period if the request is filed within 2 months of the failed time limit. 5 Jan 2009 +
2m = 5 March 2009 (Thurs)
Need to pay fee for restoration and demonstrate that all due care required by the
circumstances were takem As evidence, provide the application documents which will
be dated 24/12/2008, the ordered payment documentation and declarations from Iris
and Daphne. Need to explain your usual procedures and demonstrate that this really is
a one-off mistake by an othenvise responsible, trustworthy employee. In light of the
short deadline and no fulther documents being available, file application using GB2
specification provided and request restoration (and pay fee) by fax to the EPO with an
outline of reasons for missing the deadline and provide actual documentation later
Important to demonstrate 'all due care' since this is the criteria that the EPO will use
during the national phase as well as R.O. The USPTO does not accept requests for
restoration so will consider the application to have its filing date only.
If the request for restoration is successful, the resulting EP (and Albanian) patent will
have an effective date of GB2 - 3 Jan 2008. Hence the publication of PCT-BF, and EPI
EP2 and EP3 will not be prior art within the meaning of Article 54(2) EPC However,
PCT-BF and EPI will be Article 54(3) prior
PCT-BF does not describe slugbanite at all so is not relevant
EPI describes Slugbanite and refers to slugbanite from The Hosta La Vista mine
(slugbanite A). However, there is no explicit disclosure of slugbanite B in EPI since not
mentioned and not even inherently disclosed by the examples. Therefore the subject
matter of slugbanite B, optionally with escargines is novel.
