In the USA, the application will have an effective date of the filing date, March 2009 so
the publication of PCT-BF will be full prior art, as will the publication of EPI, EP2 and
EP3 EPI, EP2 and EP3 will have published â€”18 months after ther priority date of -July
2008 and this is within the 1 year grace period PCT-BF also published within the grace
period (Aug 2008). SH could therefore swear back behind these disclosures. It is
important to do this because even thought Slugbanite B is not disclosed in the prior art
(it is novel) it might be considered to lack an inventive step since it is well known that
Slugbanite comes in 4 forms and EPI-EP3 describe the use of slugbanite generally to
kill slugs and snails and the use of slugbanite and escargines which gives rise to a
synergistic effect. Hence, very difficult to argue that slugbanite B is inventive.
The method of preparing finely divided Slugbanite is new and likely to be found inventive
since it is highly effective so should lead to protection in EP and the US.
PCT-SH claims priority from GB2 is valid (if restoration is successful) because 'same
invention' construed narrowly so GB2 is the first application for slug-B
PCT-BF will likely lead to EP and US patents for escargines compositions and related
methods and plant pots. No search appears to be available (check this) but since EPI,
EP2 and EP3 had no relevant prior art, you would expect PCT-BF to be the same.
If BF obtains patents for escargines, SH will not be able to use their compositions
comprising both slugbanite (A or B) and escargines but could sell slugbanite only
Similarly, BF will be able to sell escargine products but not products comprising both
escargine and BF
Therefore could just split the market. However, since the synergistic effect is achieved
when both escargine + slugbanite are used it is likely that both parties will want access
to the combination.
If BF is being aggressive, it might file oppositions against EPII EP2 and EP3 based on
lack of sufficiency. BF could also oppose EP3 based on PCT-BF/EP even if the request
for limitation is filed. If successful EPI, EP2 and EP3 would be severely restricted,
allowing BF access to at least alternative sources of Slug-A and Slug-B. However, there
is no guarantee that the opposition would be successful. Further, a successful
opposition would allow anybody access to the invention, not just BF + SH
If BF is aggressive, SH can defend oppositions and refuse to licence PCT-SH (Slug-Bl
new method) and also plant pots having specific location of composition (EP3)
If BF is co-operative, could negotiate a cross licence whereby BF agrees not to oppose
EPII EP2 or EP3_
BF gets a licence under EPI , EP2 or EP3 for Slugbanites and escargines and SH gets a
licence under PCT-BF to escargines. The licence may be granted for the geographical
areas of interest. Clearly, US and Albania for BF and at least GB for SH. Clearly need
to be careful about competition issues if BF and SH have an agreement
