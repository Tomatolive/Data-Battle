Candidate's answer
PCT-BF was filed 15 Dec 2006 without a claim to priority so the 31m deadline for
entering the EP national phase is 15 Dec 2006 + 31m = 15 July 2009 (Wed). Since BF
has manufacturing facilities in Albania it is likely to enter the EP national phase If it
does so, it will be a prior national right for EPII EP2 and EP3. Check EPO register to
see whether BF have entered the national phase early and if not, carry out further file
inspections closer to the deadline. The publication of PCT-BF in August 2008 is not
prior art under Art 54(2) EPC for EPI, EP2 or EP3 because it took place after their filing
dates (and effective dates). If PCT-BF does not enter the EP national phase EPI EP2
and EP3 are definitely novel and inventive since no prior disclosure and the use of
escargines and/or slugbanite is advantageous over copper strips.
EPII EP2 (amended) and EP3 (limited) demonstrate an inventive step since the use of
copper compounds instead of copper strips is new and advantageous. Further, the
application of the compositions in stripes rather than round the rim also has unexpected
advantages.
Sufficiency of EPI. EP2 and EP3
Each of EPI EP2 and EP3 describe slugbanite generally when slugbanite A and B work
but slugbanite C and D do not Therefore it might be argued that the
patents/applications do not disclosure the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and
complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (Ait 83 EPC) or that the
claims are not supported by the description (Art 84 EPC)_ Since the example provided
does work and 2/4 types works I think there is a good argument that the requirements
for sufficiency and clarity have been met (There is no obligation that every single
combination works) In any case, there is no basis for limiting to Slug-A or Slug-Bi such
an amendment would add matter. Similarly, cannot simply disclaim the non-working
embodiments since no basis in the applications for such an amendment, so would also
add matter. If EPI, EP2 (once granted) or EP3 is opposed on the grounds of lack of
sufficiency (clarity is not a ground for opposition) then could limit the claims to the
compositions described in the examples. Can't simply specify slugbanite sourced from
the Hosta la Vista Mine, would need to take the whole teaching of the examples, rather
than randomly choose a feature that is only disclosed in combination with other
elements.
EPI was granted 1st March 2009 so an opposition can be filed up to g months later = ISt
Dec 2009 (Tues). B-F might oppose.
EPI validly claims priority from GBI since within 12m priority period and there is clear
basis in GBI because the claim uses a paragraph from GBI_ EPI has an effective date
of 6 Jan 2007. EPI was filed under EPC 2000 so PCT-BF will be prior art under Art
54(3) EPC 2000, i.e for all contracting states, if nationally phased PCT-BF does not
anticipate claim 1 of EPI because PCT-BF does not disclose using snail and slug
attractants in the compositions.
