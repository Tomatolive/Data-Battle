a) You are a representative in Munich and receive a telefax on 5 April 1994 from
a French inventor who filed a European patent application with a standard
request for grant of a European patent (EPO Form 1001. l) on 3 January 1994
claiming priority from a French patent application filed on January 1993.
He paid the filing fee, the search fee and nine designation fees, crossing
the designation boxes on Form 1001.1 against Austria (AT), Belgium (BE),
Svitzerland (CH), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), United Kingdom (GB), Italy (IT),
The Netherlands (NL) and Sweden (SE). He now realises that he ought to have
designated Denmark (DK) as well. Advise him of any action possible and its
legal basis.
b) If the European patent application had been filed on 30 December 1993, vould
your answer have been different? If so, in what vay?
c) If the European patent application in a) above had been filed initially on
January 1993 without claim to priority, vould your answer have been dif-
ferent? If so, in what way?
