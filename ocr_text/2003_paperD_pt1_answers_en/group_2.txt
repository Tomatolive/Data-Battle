Q2(c)
No - there is no pending application as required by R 25(1) EPC on which divisional may
be based.
Opposition proceedings only relate to granted patents (A 99(1) EPC).
R 60(2) EPC/A 114 EPC is not applicable to appeal proceedings in opposition because
of the different legal nature of the proceedings (G 7/91). So withdrawal of appeal by
opponent as sole appellant terminates appeal proceedings (G 7/91 Termination of
appeal occurs irrespective of whether patent satisfies requirements of EPC (G 8/93).
Intervention under A 105 EPC is admissible if filed during pending appeal proceedings
(G 1/94). But if filing of intervention and filing of sole appellants notice of withdrawal of
appeal take place on same day then their chronological order must be taken into
account (T 517/97Y Withdrawal of an appeal has immediate effect and is not postponed
to midnight on date of filing (T 51 7/97) - T 517/97 also related to filing by fax and in view
of this, in Q3 A 105 EPC intervention wouldn't be admissible (fees for opposition and
appeal would be refunded). [Doesn't matter when confirmation of fax was received].
Notice of opposition needed to be filed within 9M of publication of grant of patent
(A 99(1) EPC) ie by 100303 (Wednesday). Fee for opposition (RFee 2, item 10 = 610
Euro) was also due that day
Notice of opposition was sent in time (14.03.03)_ Fax filing allowed (OJ 1992, 299) and R
36(5) EPC EPO may request written confirmation of fax and probably good idea to send
this anyway. Fee arrived late (20.0303) by 1 day and was insufficient amount
(122 Euros too little) but this is 0K because of RFees 12(1) - 20% reduction in
opposition fee ie 20% of required amount, R 6(3) EPC for A 14(2) EPC situation.
RFees 8(3) provides that will be considered filed in time if an order was given to a
banking establishment within the period set (ie before 1003.03, which it was) and a 10%
surcharge was paid (or is within 10 days of expiry of period for paymenty Didn't pay
surcharge - so under Rule 8 fees 8(4) EPO will ask for surcharge and evidence of
transfer to bank establishment in time pay this:
Lanquaqe
Spanish opponent (by nationality) so A 14(4) EPC applies (as opposition must be filed
by time limit) - opposition can be filed in Spanish so is 0K. But must file translation
within 1M of filing document (R 6(2) EPC, A - VIII, 2.1) or else is deemed not received
(A 14(5) EPC). So have until 14.04.03 to file translation into English, French or German
under R 6(2) EPC As opposition was filed by fax, subsequent copy must be sent in
same language as fax and then copy is deemed received on date of filing fax
(A - 1k', 2.5).
