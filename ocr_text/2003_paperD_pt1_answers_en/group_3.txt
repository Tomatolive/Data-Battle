Representative
Spanish client was allowed to filed notice of opposition due to A 133(1) EPC as is
resident of a Contracting State For me to be his representative will likely need to file
authorisation under R 101 EPC (OJ 1991 , 489) as has been change of representative
(before first act done on behalf of client).
priority date
31 M period (R 107(1) EPC) expires 28.0303 (Friday).
Enter EP regional phase by 2803.03 using Form 1200, pay national basic fee
(R EPC), pay designation fees R 107(1 EPC, (as A 79(2) EPC) period will
already have expired and international search report takes place of EP search report (A
157(1) EPC), pay search fee (R EPC, A EPC) as search fee will
need to be drawn up - get 20% reduction in supplementary search report if JPO did ISR
(OJ 1979, 368); file request for examination (A 94 EPC, R EPC) and pay 3
year renewal fee (R 107(1)(g) EPC).
R 107(1 )(a) EPC requires translation of PCT application to be furnished to EPO as
required by A 158(1) EPC But not ready to file this yet (don't want to incur urgency
charges etc. by getting spec translated here into Japan by Friday) so enter European
regional phase (by doing all things noted above by 28.03_03) without filing translation of
application. R 108(3) EPC provides grace period of 2 M after notification to furnish
translation, on payment of surcharge (RFees 23(c)) - although will end up paying
surcharge this is likely to be much less than urgency charges for translation costs.
Therefore have at least 2 months for client's translation department to do this.
Not necessary to file Japanese priority document (OJ Iggg, 80, Dec. of Pres and A - Ill,
6.7) as EPO will put this in file automatically R 38(4) EPC_ Will need eventually to file
translation of this (or declaration that priority doc application as filed) by end of Rule
51 (4) EPC period.
Mr A. died, Rule 60(2) EPC indicates Mr H. can become party to opposition proceedings
but that Opposition Division may continue proceedings of its own motion without the
participation of heirs. However Guidelines D-VII, 6.2 says that this provision will also
apply where only one opposition has been filed (as is the case here). Effectively Mr H.
has been transferred Mr As business and assets of interest in which opposition was
filed, so pending opposition has also been transferred (G4/88).
Opposition is limited by extent indicated in notice of opposition, that have been properly
submitted and substantiated in the notice of opposition (G 10/91 , G 9/91): So can't
extend opposition to cover method of producing P at this stage.
