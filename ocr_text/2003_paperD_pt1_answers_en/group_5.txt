R 17(2)(a)(i) declaration means that EPO as ISA has told applicant and 1B that no
international search report will be established as the ISA considers the application to
relate to subject matter which the ISA is not required or decides not to search.
No refund of search fee will be made by EPO, EPC or PCT. PCT only provides
for refund of search fee where due to reasons of national security, the PCT
application isn't treated as such (R 16.2 PCT) or if PCT application is withdrawn
before the transmittal of the search copy to the ISA EPO also refund 100% of
search fee where PCT appln is withdrawn or considered withdrawn under Art
14(1), (3) or (4) PCT before the start of the international search or if the ISA is
based wholly or partly on an earlier search (100% and 50% respectively),
OJ 2002, 56, in line with R 16.3 and R 41 1 PCT. But no provisions for
reimbursement of search fee in this case.
Entry into the national phase is not affected by R 17(2)(a)(i) PCT declaration (A
22(2) PCT)_ However, a designated state may consider unsearched pans (ie the
only claim in this case) to be withdrawn unless the applicant pays a special fee
to the national office of that state (A 17(3)(b) PCT).
On entry into European regional phase, a European (supplementary) search
report will not be established as claim relates to a method of treatment (A 52(4)
EPC) as the subject matter is excluded from patentability, R 45 EPC
Suggest filing amended claims on entry into European regional phase, which
may have likelihood of being searched under A 92(1) EPC (will be given
opportunity to do this under R 109 EPC + R 110 EPC)_
As implant itself is new and revolutionary, file claim (product claim) to implant
Appears to have support in description and claim amendment won't add matter
over application as filed, in accordance with A 123(2) EPC and G 2/98.
G 2/88 - change of claim category allowed if no extension of protection.
QIO
Thailand is not a Paris Convention country (see OJ 2002, 216).
Thailand is a WTO country (see OJ 2002, 226).
Article 8(2)(a) PCT and R 4.10(a) PCT provide that an application in or for any country
party to the Paris Convention of the WTO can be basis of priority claim for a PCT
application So, a PCT application can validly claim the Thailand priority. BUT
R 4.10(d) PCT provides that where a designated office has laws incompatible with R
4.10(a) and (b) PCT, those paragraphs do not apply to those states for as long as the
incompatibility exists provided the office informs the 1B as required under R 4.10(d) PCT.
The EPO and the JPO have informed the EPO of this incompatibility. So at present, for
EPO and Japan, may not be able to sustain priority claim to the Thai application.
However, for EPO this question has now been referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal,
G 2/02 and G 3/02.
