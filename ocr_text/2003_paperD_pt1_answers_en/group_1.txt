Decision was deemed received on 16.12.2002, Rule 78(2) EPC and Article 119 EPC
Article 108 EPC sets period of 2M from date of notification of decision to file appeal in
writing and payment of fee (R fees. 2, Item 11). So deadline for filing notice of appeal
expired16.02.03 (Sunday), therefore extended to 17_02.03 (R 85(1) EPC). No further
processing (A 121 EPC possible).
A refusal of application by Examining Division is an appealable decision (Article 106(1)
EPC).
Applicant can make restitutio application (A 122 EPC) of 2M time limit but needs to file
request in writing within 2M of removal of non-compliance and within IY of missed time
limit; pay fee; show all due care (may be difficult here, representative should have
known about appeal period?).
Omission of reason for decision is substantial procedural error (R 67), but not sure about
communication of possibility of appeal being anything more than a courtesy service
which in view of J 1/89 cannot be relied on J 2/87 - refusal of patent is void if due to an
erroneous EPO communication (good faith). Not clear from the question if this is
erroneous communication - possibly in which case J 2/87 may apply.

patent application. Application is pending up to but not including date of mention of grant
being published under A 97(4) EPC (OJ 2002, 112), C-VI 15.5.
Combination of R 51 (4) + R 51(6) communications (OJ 2001, 488) intended to shorter
period between despatch of R 51 (4) communication and grant to about 8 months.
02.01.03 such a short time after R 51(4) acts completed that application will not yet have
granted so can file divisional application.
