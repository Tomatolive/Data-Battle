A 135(1)(b) EPC allows the national office of a Contracting State to apply procedure for
grant of a national patent at the request of the applicant/proprietor in certain
circumstances, where provided by national law.
For Portugal, (see Nat Law Table VII, cols. 1 and 5 (pg 103)) European patent applicant
cant be converted into a Portuguese patent application for the reason of refusal by EPO
(only for deemed withdrawal, A 77(5) EPC; deemed withdrawal due to A 90(3) EPC
because translation in language of proceedings under A 14(2) not filed in time). But can
convert EP application that has been refused into a Portuguese application for a utility
model (see col. 5) - could well be worthwhile doing that here.
Conversion to national utility model also has lower inventive step requirements, so might
be allowable - needs checking.
Take steps of requesting conversion within 3 M of refusal of application (A 135(2) EPC)
and then take steps referred to in cols. 2 + 3 on pg 103 Nat Law Table VII - will not need
to appoint authorised representative if applicant has place of business/residence in
Portugal.
must apply for new appln within 3 months of decision becoming final (A 61(1 ) EPC) ie by
(b)
(i) Can file new EP patent application (A 61 (1 )(b) EPC). Rule 15 EPC sets out
rules for filing new application, and A 61(2) EPC provides that provisions of A
76(1) EPC also apply to the new application A 76(1) EPC does not allow subject
matter of new application to extend beyond the content of the earlier application
as filed (and A- IV, 1.33 and A - VIII, are relevant). So client would not be
allowed to include further embodiments as this would extend beyond application
as filed contrary to A 61(2) EPC in conjunction with A 76(1) EPC.
(ii) No in view of R 37(4) EPC (which expressly refers to Article 61(1 )(b) EPC
and says no fees due in respect of year in which new application is filed and any
preceding year.
Yes still entitled to file new European patent application even if original
application A is not pending at time new application is filed (G 3/92). in fact
the only thing client can do in these circumstances is to file a new application (G
3/92) ie can't do either A 61 (l)(a) or (c) alternatives.
