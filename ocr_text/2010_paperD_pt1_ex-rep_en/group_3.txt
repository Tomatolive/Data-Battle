Possible Solution
- Paper D 2010 - Part I
Answer to question 1 :
The extent of the opposition is determined by the notice of opposition, Rule 76(2)(c) EPC_
The process claim 2 was not attacked in the notice of opposition As a consequence, the
opposition is limited to the subject-matter of the product claim 1, G9/91 or GIO/91. The
request will be rejected with respect to claim 2.
With respect to the product claim 1, novelty is a fresh ground of opposition, G7/95
Document Dn is late filed and therefore may be disregarded, Article 114(2) EPC or Rule
116(1) EPC _ However, the opposition division will assess prima facie the relevance of the
new document Dn and the fresh ground of opposition, and based on the relevance
continue of its own motion, Rule 81(1) EPC, second sentence or GIO/91
Answer to question 2:
A divisional application can serve as an earlier application in the sense of Article 76(1)
EPC, i.e parent application, GI /05 or GI/06_ Hence, DIV-2 is a valid divisional application
of DIV-I However, DIV-2 does not fulfil Article 76(1) EPC since the method is not
disclosed in DIV-I . DIV2 can however be amended with respect to Article 76(1 ) EPC even
when the earlier application is no longer pending (GI/05 or GI /06). Thus, amend DIV-2 by
deleting all contents referring to the method.
A claim directed to a football with a variable number of patches is not possible as it would
extend beyond the content of the application as originally filed because the 33 patches are
disclosed as being essential for achieving the technical effect, Article 123(2) EPC
Since the football with 33 patches made of PX is disclosed in both EP-I and DIV-I you
can keep it in DIV-2 (GI/05 or GI/06)_
Answer to question 3:
a) No, the priority has not been validly claimed. The time limit for claiming priority
according to Article 4.C(1) of the Paris Convention, to which Article 8(2)(a) PCT makes
reference, expired on 27 February 2010. This is a Saturday and is thus carried on to
Monday, 1 March 2010 according to Rule 2.4 PCT and Rule 805 PCT. As a
consequence the letter with PCT-X is received late, after the end of the priority year.
b) Restoration of the right of priority by the Receiving Office is possible according to Rule
26bis_3(a) PCT since the failure to file the international application within the priority
period occurred in spite of due care. According to Rule and (e) PCT the
request for re-establishment must be filed within two months of the expiry of the priority
period, i.e. at the latest on 3 May 2010 (Monday). The request for re-establishment
should contain all the relevant facts and circumstances, Rule 26bis_3(b)(ii)PCT_ The
prescribed fee, according to Rule PCT, must be paid within two months, Rule
26bis_3(e) PCT. The fee is 550 Euros according to RFees Article 2.13.
