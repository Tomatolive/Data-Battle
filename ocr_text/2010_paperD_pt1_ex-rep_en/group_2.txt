Question 6
Candidates were expected to answer basic questions on the effects of a European patent
in the national law of Contracting States. The framework for these effects derives from the
EPC and candidates should be acquainted with them.
Question 7
The comments for question 6 apply. It was acknowledged that candidates did not have a
calendar for 2012 and would not know that this is a leap year. Consequently, the exact
date was not required to get full marks.
Question 8
One independent claim having 24 dependent claims add up to a total of 25 claims.
Consequently, claims 16 to 25 represent ten claims and not nine This is important
because subject-matter which is only disclosed in a claim is irrevocably abandoned if the
claim fee is not paid.
Question 9
Many candidates did not cite the specific provision for the stay of proceedings in
oppositiom Some candidates had difficulty establishing when the time limit set by the
communication expired.
