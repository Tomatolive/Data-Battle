Answer to question 4:
a) The filing date according to Article 80 EPC is the date on which the filed documents
contain, according to Rule 40(1) EPC: an indication that a European patent is sought;
information identifying the applicant or allowing the applicant to be contacted
(letterhead); and a reference to a previously filed application. According to Rule 40(2)
EPC the reference has to include the filing date and number. Further, the applicant must
have provided a certified copy to the EPO, Rule 40(3) EPC, Rule 55 EPC.
b) The exceptional situation according to Article 4.C Paris Convention does not apply for
any of the following reasons: CN-A was not filed in or for the same state; CN-A was not
withdrawn before filing EP-A; or CN-A was published. The international application
cannot validly claim priority from EP-A because it is not the first application in the sense
of Article 4 Paris Convention, Article 8(2)(a) PCT. The effective date of PCT-A would
therefore be its filing date. CN-A would be pre-published prior art and would be novelty
destroying for PCT-A_
Answer to question 5:
For PCT-U, the EPO will draw up a supplementary European search report since the
USPTO was the International Searching Authority (ISA), Article 153(7) EPC, on the
invention first mentioned in the claims, i.e presently PCT-UI Rule 164(1) EPC. To
continue with the second invention PCT-lJ2i upon recept of the communication according
to Rule 161 EPC, the application should be amended to make PCT-U2 the invention first
mentioned in the claims. Alternatively, claims relating to PCT-UI should be deleted. Thus,
the EPO will draw up the supplementary European search report based on PCT-U2.
For PCT-E, there will be no supplementary European search report since the EPO was the
ISA Decision of the Administrative Council dated 25 October 2007 or OJ 2007 page 642
Hence, USCO can only proceed with the searched invention, i.e. PCT-EI, Rule 164(2)
EPC, even if PCT-E is amended to make PCT-E2 the invention first mentioned in the
claims. A divisional application will have to be filed directed to PCT-E2
Answer to question 6:
Italy requires translation of the patent specification within three months from mention of the
grant in the Bulletin according to Alticle 65(1) EPC and National law relating to the EPC,
Table IV or OJ 2008 page 123 The three months period ended 9 February 2010, hence
the translation was duly filed.
Italy has adopted the provision pursuant to Alticle 70(3) EPC, see National law relating to
the EPC, Table V. Because the translated claim is narrower than the claim in the language
of the proceedings, the translation is regarded as authentic in Italy.
According to Article 70(4)(a) EPC, X may file a corrected translation. Neveltheless, Y is
allowed to continue to produce and sell even after the corrected translation was made
available because Italy has made provision pursuant to Alticle 70(4)(b) EPC, see National
law relating to the EPC, Table V. Thus, X cannot stop Y _ However, if Y did not act in good
faith according to Article 70(4)(b) EPC, X can stop Y _
