Examiners' Report Paper D 2010
General Remarks
- Part I
As always, reading the questions carefully is crucial for formulating a correct and complete
response. It is essential to work with up to date material. The citation of most appropriate
legal bases is required in this paper, although the mere citation of a legal basis cannot
constitute an answer to a question and will not earn enough marks to pass the paper.
Similarly, simply reproducing the facts of a question does not gain any marks. In preparing
for the examination, candidates are remnded to consult the Examination Syllabus as
defined in Article 13 REE and the corresponding provisions in the IPREE
Question 1
Some candidates had difficulties in determining the degree to which the opposition division
can examine of its own motion: (i) the extent to which a patent is opposed; and (ii) the
grounds of oppositiom
Question 2
Here it was important that candidates realise the requirements for filing divisional
applications, especially concerning a chan of divisional applications and the subject-
matter disclosed in each member of the chaim In addition candidates were expected to
apply Article 76(1) EPC and Article 123(2) EPC While the former defines requirements
relating to the filing of a divisional application, the latter has to be observed for all
European patent applications when examining amendments.
Question 3
This question was directed to PCT proceedings. Replies based on the EPC are not correct
and could not be awarded any marks. The PCT has its own provisions for both claiming
priority, including a reference to the Paris Convention, and restoration of priority rights.
Rule 26bis.3 PCT includes detailed provisions split across ten paragraphs (a) to (j), some
of which are relevant to this question. It is necessary to cite the relevant paragraphs in
order to gain full marks
Question 4
Even though most candidates saw that EP-A cannot serve as a basis for claiming priority,
some candidates did not conclude that the effective date of PCT-A is therefore its filing
date. Consequently, the pre-published CN-A constitutes prior art for the PCT application.
Question 5
This question was generally answered either very well or rather badly. The question had
one key point: where the EPO carries out a supplementary search report, applicants can
take advantage of the opportunity to amend the claims.
