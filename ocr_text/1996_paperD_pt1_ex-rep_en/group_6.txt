The designations Of US, JP, DE and GB for a national patent are all valid (Art. 4(1) PCT). The
Netherlands has, pursuant to Art. 45(2) PCT, closed the national route for international
applications filed on or after 01.04, 1995, consequently a national patent can not be obtained for
the present application filed on 20.04.1995. The international application will be deemed to
include a request for grant of a European patent designating the Netherlands. (See also OJ EPO
1995, 457).

When the EP application was filed, it was not stated that the invention had been displayed at an
exhibition in accordance with Art. 55(l)(b) EPC. Art. 55(2) requires that in order for such a
disclosure not to be taken into account in assessing novelty (Art. 54), in accordance with
Art. 55(1), the applicant is required to state when filing the European patent application that the
invention has been so displayed, and to provide a supporting certificate. In accordance with
Rule 23 EPC, such a certificate must be filed within 4 months Of filing; this deadline has been
missed.
The applicant is still within the 6 month deadline specified in Art. 55(1), therefore it is
recommended to the client either to file a PCT application designating Europe and the USA or
a European and a US (national) application.
Vis vis the EPO it should be ensured that it is clearly on the PCT or EP application
form that the invention was displayed at the international exhibition (Art. 55(2) EPC), and the
relevant certificate should be filed in accordance with Rule 23 EPC
If the PCT route is chosen the relevant certificate can be filed upon entry into the regional phase,
m accordance with Rule EPC. In the USA the client has one year grace period as from
the first disclosure
