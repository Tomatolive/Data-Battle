(a) Yes, since the language of the priority application is not one of the official languages of
the EPO, in accordance with Art. 88(1) EPC, 1st sentence, a translation of the priority
documents into one Of the offlcial languages has to be filed.
(b) Alternatively, in accordance with Rule 38(4), a declaration that the Europeul patent
application is a complete translation Of the previous application may be submitted.
(c) Under Rule 38(4) EPC, the translation (or declaration) must be filed within the time limit
set by the EPO (extendable under Rule 84 EPC), but at the latest must be filed within the
non-extendable time limit laid down In Rule 51(6) EPC, see GL, A-III, 6.8.
(a) Under Art 99(1), 1st sentence opposition must be filed within 9 months of the publication
Of the mention of the grant of the European patent to company A. In accordance with
Art 99(1) and Rule 85(1), since 04.02.1996 was a Sunday, the opposition period expired
on 05.02.1996, therefore opposition can no longer be filed.
It is therefore advised to intervene as assumed infringer. Under Art 105(1), 1st sentence,
intervention as assumed infringer is possible since:
(i) from the information given an opposition procedure is pending before the EPO (B's
opposition);
(ii) the patent proprietor A has instituted proceedings for infringement of the European
patent against C;
(iii) the time limit for intervention assumed infringer which is three months from the
date of institution Of proceedings against C by A, has not yet expired (expires
28.05.1996).
In accordance with Art. 105(2) EPC, notice Of intervention has to be filed in a written
reasoned statement (Art. 105(2), 1st sentence) and the opposition fee has to be paid
(Art. 105(2), 2nd sentence).
C is not limited to the grounds of originally filed, in accordance with
Art. 105(2), 3rd sentence, after notice of intervention has been filed, it shall, subject to any
exceptions laid down in the implementing regulations, be treated as an opposition,
GL D-VII,7.
A less preferred altemative is for C to file observations under Art. 115 EPC but in this case
he will not be a party to the proceedings.
