Art. 87(4) EPC for the feature A. The answers to parts (a) and (b) therefore remain

Question 10
Under Art. 99(1) EPC, opposition can be filed against A's patent until 9 months from the
publication of the mention of the grant Of the patent on 05.07.1995, i.e. until 05.041996,
extendable under Rule 85(1) until 09.04.1996.
Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant lodge an opposition to A's patent based on the
document found. It is allowable to file opposition even though the patent has expired in all
designated states under Art. 99(3) EPC
The EPO will notifr the opponent under Rule 60(1) EPC and, if continuation is requested within
two months of notification, the Opposition continues with the probable consequence that
revocation will occur. Revocation Of A's patent would give company B the retroactive (ex tunc)
effect Of Art. 68 EPC, rather than the ex nunc effect Of national expiry, see T 329/88, supplement
to OJ EPO 6/1994, 117.

is a Sunday, the due date for payment without additional fee is extended to Monday

the due date provided that additional fee is paid at the same time, consequently the
