No, in the decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal GI/94 (OJ EPO 1994, 787), it was
decided that the term "opposition proceedings" used in Art. 105 EPC was not restricted to
the department of first instance, but could also refer to such proceedings at second instance.
Intervention during appeal proceedings was therefore admissible. The intervener should pay
the appeal fee to ensure that the appeal remains in force.

No, in accordance with Art. ) PCT, any resident or national of a contracting state of the
PCT may file an international application. Since South Africa is not a PCT contracting
State, the application cannot proceed in the name Of the South African.
In the case of an Australian citizen resident in Australia, since Australia is a contracting
state of the PCT, an international PCT application could proceed in the name of the
Australian, in accordance with Art. 9(1) PCT. However, such an application could not
proceed at the EPO since in accordance with Art. 10 in conjunction with Rule 19.1 PCT,
the intemational application shall be filed with the national offce of or acting for the
contracting state of which the applicant is a resident or with the national office of or acting
for the contracting state of which the applicant is a national or with the International
Bureau.
In the present case the EPO may, however, act on behalf Of the International Bureau under
Rule 19.4 PCT. Under that rule, the EPO will receive the application, date stamp it and
forward it to the International Bureau.

The only course of action which could save the application is requesting re-establishment of
rights under Art. 122 EPC. Such a request would be inadmissible if the two month time limit
referred to in Art. 122(2) EPC had already expired or if a year had passed from the missed
renewal fee.
At the time Of the notification pursuant to Art. 86(3) and Rule 69(1) EPC, (application deemed
to be withdrawn), the applicant had no representative and would therefore be notified by ordinary
letter post in accordance with Rule 78(2). In accordance with Rule 78(2) the date of receipt Of
the communication pursuant to Rule 69(l)EPC is considered to be when despatch has taken
place, i.e. 29.09.1995. This date would count as the date of removal of the cause of
noncompliance for the purposes of Art. 122(2) EPC, unless the applicant is able to prove that he
received the communication on a later date, in such a case the significant date is the actual date
of receipt by the applicant according to the case law (J7/82). This must be checked with the
client
In any event it is unlikely that the applicant could be said to have exercised Hall due care" in
accordance with Art. 122(1) in observing the time limit in question.
