As every year, there were sorr questions which well answer«i by virtually all candidates, whilst
Other questions caused diffculty for many. Comments are given below only on the questions that
were found diffcult. However, as a general point, it was clear from the answers on many of the
questions that a significant number of candidates were working from out of date revision books and
texts Ihis «ror can easily lose a candidate the critical marks needd Once again, a surprisingly high
number ofcarxiidates to read the questions caremlly Many also clearly did not use "time-lines"
when answering appropriate questions.
Many candidates concentrated on Rule 38(4) and overlooked Art. 88 which makes the filing ofthe
priority translation a requirement
In part (b) very few suggested the safeguard of paying the appeal fee to ensure the appeal remained
in force.
(b) A large nurnberwere unaware that if the application was filed at the EPO nothing was lost and
that the EPO acted for the International Bureau under Rule 19.4 PCT.
Question 4
This was poorly answered with many candidates indiscriminately suggesting an appeal, Karther
processing and reinstatement as equal possibilities. Very many took the date of the client's letter to
the representative as the date of removal of the cause ofnon-compliance rather than the date of actual
receipt ofthe Rule 1) communication by the applicant
Very few candidates obtained filll marks on this question. The use Of the first application for the
purpose of claiming priority was commonly overlooked - although one candidate suggested that, as
a valid filing it was possible to use it as the priority for a convention application in the USA but that,
unfortunately, no rights could be obtained in the EPO A further very common misconception was
that the exhibition itself could be used as a priority right. Only a small proportion knew that it was
necessary to give on the application form notification of the exhibition. Rule 88 was erroneously
proposed by some candidates.
