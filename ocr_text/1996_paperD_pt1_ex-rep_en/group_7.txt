Yes, in accordance with Rule 2(1), 1st sentence and Rule 2(5) EPC. Provided that the EPO
is notified at least one month prior to the date set for oral proceedings (18.06.1996 in this
case), the EPO has to make provisions for interpretation; otherwise the opponent himself
must make the provisions for interpretation and pay the costs

official language of the EPO but is an official language of one of the contracting states, it

No, in accordance with Art. 87(1) the right of pnonty extends for a penod of 12 months
from the date of filing of a first application for the same invention in a state which is party
to the Paris convention.
For the feature A, this period expires on 28.10.1994, 12 months after filing Of DEI. In
accordance with Art. 87(4), DE2 could Only be considered as a first filing for the feature
A, provided that DEI had been withdrawn, abandoned or refused without being made open
to public inspection, and had not served as a basis for claiming a right of priority. Since this
is not the case, EP cannot claim the priority of DE2, for the feature A. Hence the effective
filing date for assessing novelty and inventive step of A is 27.09.1995, i.e. the date of filing
Since feature B is not disclosed in DEI, and since EP is filed within the 12 month period
after filing of DE2, (which represents the first filing for B) the priority claimed for feature
B is valid in accordance with Art. 87(1) EPC
Feature A is not new within the definition Of Art. 54(2) EPC and therefore, a claim to
feature A is not allowable under Art. 52(1) EPC
Feature B of EP is novel.
Since EP validly claims the priority Of DE2 the priority date counts as the filing date for
the purposes of Art 54(2) EPC (Art. 89 EPC)_ DEI is not prior art in the sense of
Art. 54(2) nor is it prior art in the sense Of Art. 54(3) since it is not an EP application. DEI
does, however, constitute a national prior right within the meaning of Art. 139(2) EPC and
could be used in Germany but only in revocation proceedings.
Because DE2 claims priority from DEI, even if DEI were withdrawn/abandoned without
having been published, DE2 cannot be considered to be a first application as defined in
