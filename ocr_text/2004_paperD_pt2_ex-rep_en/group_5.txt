compensation cannot be sought for Leda's past sale. Continued manufacture by
Leda in Slovakia is possible.
By Zeus
Zeus will not be able to sell into US, Japan, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Estonia (and
perhaps Czech Republic).
Klondyke will not be able to buy the chips from Zeus once the US patent resulting
from Leda-PCT is granted.
Since Zeus are situated in the Czech Republic, it would be valuable to obtain
protection through Leda-PCT and so it is important to check the status of Zeus-CZ
and clarify its prior art effect against Leda-PCT_
However, even if Leda-PCT is valid in the Czech Republic, the effect of any right of
prior use law in Czech Republic should be checked.
Since Zeus has protection in most European states and Leda will have protection in
LIS and Japan, a cross licence appears to be inevitable if both Zeus and Leda are to
be free of risk.
Improving Leda's position
Leda's US designation gives them a strong position, as they will be able to stop Zeus
in US and so it is advisable to enter the US regional phase as soon as possible to try
to get early grant.
To avoid Zeus strengthening their position, wait until the validation period for Zeus-
EP has expired before contacting Zeus.
File an application for Leda's chip modified with Electra's circuit, or incorporate this
into the circuit applications to be made.
Opposition to Zeus-EP does not appear sensible, both because exhaustive searches
have found nothing and because anything that damages Zeus-EP will damage Leda-
What to tell Klondyke
Inform Klondyke of Leda's US patent position and of ZeuSs European position and
assure them that Leda can continue to supply the US Advise them that Leda will be
seeking a licence to ensure freedom to sell into Europe. Ask Klondyke to delay their
reply so as to keep Leda's identity secret.
