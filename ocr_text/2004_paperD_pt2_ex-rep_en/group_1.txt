Examiners' Report on Paper Dll
In the first pan of this paper, candidates had to deal with different inventions made by
Electra Optic and its new subsidiary, Oedpus Electric. Not all candidates made the
differentiation between the "basic software", the "improved software" and the circuit,
which was rather crucial in view of the priority issues involved with the 'basic software"
and the circuit In fact, few candidates located this problem and did realise that filing an
application for the basic software in the name of Electra Optic (as wished by the client)
had risks with regard to priority. Many candidates proposed to file one single application
for all inventions and so failed to get the maximum patent term for the client
Further, not all candidates seemed to know the practice of the EPO regarding protection
of computer implemented inventions which means that some ignored this aspect of the
question.
Lastly, not all candidates realised the special situation of Taiwan (not member of PCT
and of Paris Convention but WTO member) and some made the mistake of putting
South Korea in the same basket.
In the second pan of this paper, candidates were asked to advise as to the status of
Leda-PCT and as to the situation regarding competitor Zeus. In contrast to the first pan,
most candidates gave a thorough analysis of the status of Leda-PCT and also made
recommendations on how to tackle the problems with Zeus. In particular, they mostly got
the important aspect of freedom in the USA and Japan. But not all candidates realised
that the Zeus-EP was filed too early to have the possibility of designating CZ, SK, BG
and EE whereas Leda-PCT could take advantage of this possibility. As a result, the
candidates who missed the point, did not realise the possibilities offered to Leda as a
consequence, i.e. free manufacturing in Slovakia and perhaps the possibility to stop
Zeus in the Czech Republic.
Another point which was missed by certain candidates, was the fact that Zeus-EP had to
be validated in the designated states in the near future in order to stop manufacture or
sale of chips in EP countries.
Simply mentioning cross licensing without indicating what was being licensed in
exchange did not gain marks.
