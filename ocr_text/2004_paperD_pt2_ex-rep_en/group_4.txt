It may be possible to obtain a still longer term of protection in the USA by use of the
"grace period" but detailed advice from a US attorney would have to be sought.
The problem with Leda
Relative rights
For Zeus
Zeus-EP has the earliest priority date (November 2000). Zeus-EP was published
after filing of Leda-EP (December 2001). Therefore Zeus-EP is prior art under
Art54(3)EPC to the European designation of Leda-PCT for novelty only and in
respect of commonly designated states.
The period for validating Zeus-EP expires April 2004 in most countries and so
coverage throughout the designated states may be possible.
For Leda
Leda-PCT was filed December 2002 The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Estonia acceded to EPC July 2002 and so are covered by the European designation
of Leda-PCT
So far as these countries are concemed, Zeus-EP is not prior art at all because it
was not possible to designate these countries at the time of filing Zeus-EP. However
Zeus-CZ may be a prior national right in the Czech Republic.
Since grant of Zeus-EP was obtained it is likely that protection in Slovakia, Bulgaria
and Estonia for Leda-EP will be obtained. Protection in Czech Republic for Leda-EP
depends upon the fate of Zeus-CZ and Czech law.
Since there seems to be no US or Japanese equivalent to Zeus-EP, the Leda-PCT
designations in these countries would appear to have no problems.
Potential for infringement
By Leda
Zeus-EP will prevent manufacture or sale of chips only in those designated countries
where the patent is validated.
Since Zeus have no US protection, Klondyke's activities in US could not infringe, but
bringing product into EPC countries could infringe, and Zeus could seek an injunction
in those designated countries where Zeus-EP is validated.
As there was no publication of Zeus-EP at the time of Leda's sale, and because in
any event Zeus-EP does not cover Slovakia (where Leda are situated) damages or
