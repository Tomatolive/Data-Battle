without serving as a basis for priority. Therefore, under Alticle 87(4) EPC and
corresponding PC provision, Electra-Fl may be considered to be the first application
if Electra takes assignment and tries to claim priority from Oedipus-EP_
However, so far as Oedipus are concemed, Oedipus-EP is the first application.
Therefore, to reduce the risk of priority problems, it is preferable not to record
assignment but to file in name of Oedipus, and then perhaps assign later. To be
absolutely sure, leave the applications in the name of Oedipus (which continues to
exist as a legal entity).
In any event, to be effective under the EPC, an assignment must be in writing and
signed by both parties. Thus, the assignment is not yet effective. So, Electra should
not sign yet.
Circuit
The circuit was not disclosed at the conference and as it is not obvious from the
basic software should be patentable in its own right
The circuit is Dr. Panopticon's invention and can be part of separate applications in
name of Electra.
The circuit was first disclosed in Electra-Fl. As Electra-Fl was used as a basis for a
priority claim, a fresh priority date cannot be established now for future use and
therefore national applications (or PCT plus Taiwan national application) without
priority claim are required.
Dr. Panopticon must be named as inventor-applicant for USA. For Europe, Japan
and Czech Republic simply name him as inventor.
Improved Software
Like the circuit, the improved software was not disclosed at the conference, and as it
is not obvious from the basic software should be patentable in its own right. Also, the
improved softvvare is Dr_ Panopticon's invention and can be part of separate
applications in name of Electra
However, the improved software was not disclosed in Electra-Fl but first disclosed in
Electra-EP_ As Electra-EP was withdrawn without any publication, without serving as
a basis for priority and without leaving any rights outstanding, a fresh priority basis
could be established.
Although it would make sense in terms of cost to file together with the circuit
applications
filing an original application and then claiming priority in a later PCT application gives
extra years protection, however given the position of Taiwan the legal basis for
claiming priority would need to be investigated.
The camera and other aspects
The circuit and improved softvvare applications as appropriate could also claim a
camera including the improved software, the circuit or both
In any event, the circuit and improved software applications should be filed before
publication of the joint paper by Miss Wopia and Dr Panopticon.
