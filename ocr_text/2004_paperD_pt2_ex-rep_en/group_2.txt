Possible Solution
The inventions of Miss Myopia and Dr. Panopticon
Despite the provisions of Art 52(2)(c) EPC , which provides that software "as such"
is not patentable, software may be patentable if technical in nature.
Image enhancement software for digital cameras seems sufficiently technical to merit
protection as image enhancement is a technical effect.
The inventions were derived separately by Dr_ Panopticon and Miss Myopia, and
applications were filed at different times and so each invention needs to be
considered separately.
Basic software
The basic software was first disclosed in Electra-Fl, and later Electra-EP, however,
Electra-Fl and Electra-EP are not prior art to Oedipus-EP since both were withdrawn
before publication
The basic software was disclosed at the conference, but as this was after the filing of
Oedipus-EP, the conference does not constitute prior an against Oedipus-EP, but will
be prior art for later applications for any matter that cannot claim priority of Oedipus-
To maximise the patent term it would be desirable to file fresh applications, as the
term of a patent runs from the filing date, not the priority date, and to avoid the prior
art effect of the conference disclosure, such applications should claim priority of
Oedipus-EP_
National applications can be filed covering the EPO, Japan, South Korea and US (or
as a PCT application) covering the basic softv,'are, its use in a camera and the
resulting camera, and claiming priority of Oedipus-EP_ The Czech Republic is an
EPC Member State and so will be covered by the EP application or the EP
designation in the PCT application Miss Myopia should be named as inventor, and
should be the inventor-applicant for USA and an assignment of US rights will be
required.
For Taiwan, a PCT application is not possible since Taiwan is not a PCT member.
Taiwan is not a Paris Convention country but recently became a member of
and so whether priority may be claimed in Taiwan needs to be investigated. If priority
cannot be claimed then the disclosure at conference may invalidate claims to the
basic software in Taiwan.
However, if during EPO or national proceedings attention is drawn to Electra-Fl and
Electra-EP, the validity of the priority claim can be challenged if Oedipus-EP is
transferred to Electra prior to filing the further applications.
The right to priority belongs to a person who has filed an earlier application or their
successor in title (Art 87(1) EPC). Under the Paris Convention (Article 4PC) and
the EPC (Art87(4)) a later application in or in respect of a given state can be
considered the first application if any earlier application in or in respect of that state
has been withdrawn without publication, without leaving any rights outstanding and
