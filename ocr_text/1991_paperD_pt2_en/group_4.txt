— short vave radiation treatment (invention B) .
Both types of treatnent bestov upon the plastic material
completely new, unforeseen and technically very desirable
propert i es.
Unfortunately, on 1 September 1989, our competitors X filed a
patent application in the Federal Republic of Germany
disclosing and claining the heat treatnent of the naterial in
question over a period of one to five hours at a temperature
of 100 to 300 • C. The application did not indicate any special
values or ranges Of values tor tenperature and heating time
other than the above—mentioned broad ranges. The problem and
all the other features Of the invention in the German patent
appl ication are identical to our invention Our Swiss
patent application for this invention A vas not filed until
IO January 1990. It specities a temperature range of 180 to
200 • C and a more limited treatment time of one to tvo hours,
since Ve had discovered that vorking outside these relatively
narrov limits did not produce the desired resuit. A
corresponding European application for the states CH. DE, FR
and GB, claiming the priority of the Swiss application
mentioned above, vas fi led by us on 9 January 1991. In their
European application, as filed On 31 August 1990 for the
states CH. DE, FR, GB and NL, claiming the priority of the
German application of 1 September 1989, our competitors
described the heat treatnent as being 180 to 200•C for a
period of one to two hours, with the result that the contents
of both applications are identical.
