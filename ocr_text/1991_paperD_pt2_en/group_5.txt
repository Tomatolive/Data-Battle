Our European patent application for invention B for the
states BE, CH, DE, FR, GB and NL was filed on 5 Novenber 1990;
no priority vas claimed. To Our astonishnent a European patent
application by Svedish firm Y vas published on 2 January 1991
that had been filed on 30 June 1989, also vithout claining an
earlier priority date, for the States CH. DE, FR, GB and SE.
A nenber of our staff had visited Y in spring 1989 and,
in the course of a talk, vhich vas confidential, told then
about invention B, vhich he had conpleted but — for lack Of
sutticient interest at that time — not filed. The head Of our
patent department pointed out to firm Y that their actions
constituted "unlavfui dispossession". Firm Y did not dispute
the above facts but stated that, since Ve had never indicated
that Ve vanted to patent the developnent ourselves, they
vished to keep the application tor thenselves, particularly
since they had gone to considerable expense to file it.
Closer investigation revealed that whereas our appl
described and clained tvo different, mutually independent,
enbodinents of the short—vave radiation process, firm Y • s
application disclosed only one enbodinent.
Please advise us hov Ve can Secure our rights and prevent firm
Y from acquiring a patent with earlier priority. We vould of
course like to obtain the best possible protection for this
invention. What steps should ve take nov and in the future and
on vhat legal grounds Can ve base Our case?
