Basie,
Dear Patent Attorney ,
4 April 1991
I an the manager Of the Sviss W. Tell involved in
developnent in a variety Of fields. We have a small patent
department, the head of vhich — our only patent expert
unfortunately had to be admitted to hospital Very suddenly on
21 March 1991. We are therefore unable to geek his advice.
Our most pressing problen is an appeal ti led by us — as the
opponent — against a decision of an Opposition Division of
the European patent Office. Notification Of the decision,
dated 14 November 1990, vas received by us on 16 Novenber
1990. On 23 January 1991 ve filed a notice of appeal and a
cheque for the appeal fee (but no statenent of grounds) vith
the EPO. There is a remark in the file vhich states that the
statement of grounds had to be submitted by 25 March 1991.
Furthermore, there is a rough draft in the file headed
"grounds" . The Circumstances described above Ought to be
sufficient reasons for obtaining an extension of the tine
limit as Ve requested by a telex Of 22 March 1991. please
advise us how to proceed.
We vould also like to know hov you Viev the situation
regarding the folloving patent applications fi led by us:

Of a plastic material that has long been commercial Iy
available under the name "Super 2000". This naterial can be
