Answer to Question 9
Yes. It will be successful if an appeal is validly filed. The opposition division has made a
procedural error, see GI/91 , OJ EPO 1992, 253 or GL D-V, 2.2, since unity of invention
is not one of the requirements of the Convention which a patent amended under Art.
102(3) EPC has to fulfil.
Either the opposition division will rectify (Article 109 EPC) or the Board Of appeal will set
the decision aside, and maintain the patent as amended.
The appeal fee will be refunded under Rule 67 EPC.
Answer to Question 10
a)
b)
Yes, provided the Greek representative is allowed to act before the EPO either
because of Article 134(1) EPC or Article 134(7) EPC.
There is a reduction by under Rule 107(2) EPC, Article 12(2) RFees, since
EPO acted as IPEA. From the remaining 50%, there is a further reduction by 20%
under Rule 6(3) EPC, Article 12(1) RFees, because the request for examination
was made in an admissible language different from the official languages of the
EPO Therefore, 40% of the examination fee had to be paid. (see also Notes on
EPO Form 1200, Number 111.6.2)
