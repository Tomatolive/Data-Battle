generally well answered. Most candidates, however, did not realise that Article 55
(1) EPC could also be applied to the cases of parts (b) and (c) with an earlier CO-
pending application according to Article 54 (3) EPC. Many candidates referred to
proceedings under Article 60 EPC for parts (b) and (c) which was not however
within the scope of the question.
This question was answered quite well.
Many candidates failed to check whether the 12 months time limit for claiming
priority is actually observed. Such checking involved the application of Rule 85 (1)
EPC. Candidates often did not pay attention to the time for filing a useful request
for correction under Rule 88 EPC
Most candidates were aware Of Rule 84a EPC and Of the President's Decision,
and consequently provided good answers
Most candidates were aware of GI/91. However, it was rarely clear whether
candidates recognized that G 1/91 was about whether unity of invention came
under the requirements that a European patent has to meet under Art. 102(3)
EPC when the patent is to be maintained in amended form. Full marks required
also mentioning the applicability of Article 109 EPC and Rule 67 EPC (thus to
request refund of the appeal fee).
Some candidates confused the provisions of Article 133 EPC with those of Article
134 EPC. Some candidates were unable to correctly accumulate the fee reductions.
