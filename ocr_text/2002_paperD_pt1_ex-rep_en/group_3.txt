Answer to Question 1
- 2002
Rule 18(1 ) EPC states that the person designated as the inventor shall be mentioned as
such in the published European patent application and the European patent
specification, unless the said person informs the EPO in writing that he waives his right
to be mentioned.
The request must be received in time to be effective before publication, ie before
technical preparations for publication have been completed
Answer to Question 2
a)
b)
Inform the EPO of the situation. The EPO will declare the proceedings interrupted
according to Rule 90(1)(b) EPC from 5 December 2000. Proceedings will be then
resumed according to Rule 90(2) EPC. If the proceedings are interrupted, reply to
the outstanding Office action within four months from the date of resumption, pay
the renewal fee for the third year on a date fixed by the EPO without surcharge or
within six months from that date with surcharge (see Jxx/87) and pay the renewal
fee for the fourth year on 31 May 2002 without surcharge. Even if the proceedings
are not resumed by that date it is allowed to pay up to one year before the due
date.
As according to T 315/87 the grounds for restitutio are less severe, just to be sure
to have the application saved, you have in any case to ask for restitution.
Request for restitutio in integrum according to Article 122 EPC ultimately on
19 May 2002 extended under Rule 85(1) EPC to 21 May 2002 by arguing that in
spite of all due care it was not possible to act on this application because of
financial problems.
Complete the omitted acts when applying for restitutio by
- replying to the outstanding Office action
- paying the renewal fee for the third year
Pay two fees for re-establishments Of rights according to J 26/95
File request for restitutio in integrum. Restitutio can be successful where the
applicant can show that severe financial problems stopped him from taking actions.
