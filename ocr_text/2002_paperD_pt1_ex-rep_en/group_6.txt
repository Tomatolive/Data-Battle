Answer to Question 7
The 12 month term of Art. 87 EPC ends on 18/02/2002, since 16/02/2002 is a Saturday,
Rule 85(1) EPC.
a)
b)
c)
Priority claim is valid in accordance with Article 87(3) EPC, because it is only
necessary to have a valid filing date and the outcome Of the earlier application has
no consequence.
Priority claim is not valid. According to Rule 38(2) EPC the date and the state Of
the previous filing must be stated on filing the European patent application.
However, correction according to Rule 88 EPC seems allowable according to
J9/91. Therefore, file request immediately.
Priority claim may be corrected under Rule 88 EPC. File the request for correction
sufficiently early for the correction or a warning to be included in the application to
be published (Guidelines A-III 6.5).
Answer to Question 8
4 October 2001 is more than 5 days before the expiry of the time limit for priority (Art.
87(1) EPC), which is 10 October 2001. 31 October 2001 is less than three months after
the same time limit.
The EPO may ask MS Sumo to file a confirmation of receipt by the delivery service
(Article 1 Of the Decision Of the President Of the EPO dated 1 1 December 1998 (OJ EPO
1999, 45)).
The time limit under Article 87(1 ) EPC is thus deemed to be met according to Rule 811 a
EPC provided that:
i) the delivery service used by Ms Sumo belongs to those recognised by the EPO
(Article 2 Of the before-mentioned decision)
ii) the method of despatch of the request for grant documents complies with Article 3
Of the before-mentioned decision.
The further requirements which have to be fulfilled so far are complied with
(Article 87(1), 88(1) and Rule 38(1) EPC).
The EPO includes free of charge a copy Of the earlier application in the file Of the
European patent application see Decision of the President of the EPO dated
22 December 1998 (OJ EPO 1999, 80).
A translation of the priority application is to be filed within the time limit of Rule 51 (6)
EPC (Rule 38(5) EPC). A declaration under Rule 38(5) EPC would be sufficient.
