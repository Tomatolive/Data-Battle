Examiners' Report Paper D
General Remarks
- 2002
When a specific question is asked, a specific answer is expected. Some candidates
appear to waste valuable time to address issues that are not relevant to the questions
given. Some others try to give comprehensive answers covering different specific
questions (especially in part Dll), very Often confusing different issues and thus losing
points.
Marks are given for providing answers, not for simply repeating the facts given in the
questions.
Citing articles, rules, decisions etc. is not per se an answer. Citations should support the
answers, not take their place.
Candidates should not apply EPC provisions to PCT situations, and viceversa.
Candidates should pay more attention to time calculations.
Finally, candidates are free to chose the order they prefer to give their anwers;
however, in Dll, the order of the questions is chosen to make it easier to address all the
necessary aspects in a logical progression.

This question was generally answered well. Many candidates, however, missed
marks by not mentioning that the inventor's request has to be filed with the EPO
before the technical preparations for publication are completed.
Many candidates had difficulties with this question. It was generally missed for
part (a) that prudently the provisions of Rule 90 and Art. 122 EPC needed to be
applied. The effect of Rule 90 was generally not well understood. Furthermore,
hardly any candidate addressed the payment of the fourth renewal fee. Few
candidates saw that each of the two requests under Article 122 requires the
payment of a respective fee. For part (b), many candidates failed to realise that
restitutio can be successful in a situation where an applicant can show that
severe financial problems stopped him from taking actions.
For part (1), most candidates found that Rule 26bis1 -a PCT is relevant for this
case. However, some did not correctly calculate and compare the two time limits
Of four and 16 months, and particularly failed to appreciate that the time limit
having the later date applies. For part (2), only few candidates mentioned the
possibility of Rule 17. lc PCT according to which the priority document can be
filed with the national or regional offices.
The question was generally well answered. Those few candidates who were
completely unaware of Rule 59.3 PCT normally still received marks for applying
the provisions of Article 39 (1 ) PCT.
Most candidates saw that this is a situation falling under the provisions of Article
55 (1 ) EPC Most candidates also correctly applied the calculation of the six-
month period according to G3/98 and G2/99. Consequently, part (a) was
