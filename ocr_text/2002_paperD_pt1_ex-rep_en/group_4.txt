b)
According to Article 4 A(l) PC, a German utility model can be used for claiming
priority. According to Rule 26 bis l.a PCT a priority claim may be added within a
time limit of 16 months starting from the earliest priority date. i.e. 27 December
2000 + 16 months = 27 April 2002.
The addition may be made until the expiration Of 4 months from the intemational
filing date, i.e. 19 December 2001; this time limit expires on 19 April 2002.
The later date applies. Therefore, the last date for adding the forgotten German
utility model is the 27 April 2002 extended to 29 April 2002 (Rule 80.5 PCT). This is
still possible.
According to Rule 17.1 .a PCT, if one claims priority a certified priority document
should be filed at the latest 16 months after the priority date
However if the certified priority document issued on 20 May 2002 is filed directly
with WIPO before publication of the international application, which is according to
Article 21.2a PCT about 18 months from the priority, i.e. at the earliest on the
27 June 2002. The priority document will then be deemed to have been received
on 29 April 2002.
Altematively, file the priority document according to Rule 17.1 .c PCT with the
national or regional offices.
Answer to Question 4
The demand for preliminary examination was not filed with the competent authority
(EPO), Article 31 PCT.
However, under Rule 59.3 PCT, the UK Patent Office must mark the date of receipt on
the demand. The UK Patent Office will transmit it to either the EPO or the International
Bureau. The demand is then considered to have been received by the competent
authority on the date it was received by the UK Patent Office. So the demand is
considered to have been filed within the 19-month time limit.
The time limit for entry into the regional or national phase is 30 months, in accordance
with Article PCT
However, applying the provisions Of Article 39(1)(b) PCT and Rule 107(1) EPC, the
applicant has 31 months to enter the regional phase before the EPO
The time limit for entering the US national phase expired on 18 March 2002 (too late).
The time limit for entering the EP regional phase expires on 18 April 2002.
