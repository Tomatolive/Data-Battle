Answer to Question 5
There is an evident abuse within the meaning of Article 55(1) (a) EPC.
For the calculation of the six-month period referred to in Article 55(1) (a) EPC, the
relevant date is the actual filing date of the European patent application; the date of
priority is not to be taken into account in calculating this period; G 3/98 and G 2/99
Therefore:
a)
b)
c)
Yes, since public disclosure (25/10/2000) was earlier than six months preceding
the filing Of the application as required by Article 55(1) (a) EPC
No, since public disclosure (10/10/2001) was not earlier than six months preceding
the filing Of the application as required by in Article 55(1) (a) EPC:
Although B's application is a co-pending application under Article 54(3) EPC it has
to be disregarded because Article 55(1)(a) EPC refers to Article 54 EPC as a
whole.
Same as b) irrespective of the fact that B's application was published (15/11/2001 )
after the filing date of A's application.
Answer to Question 6
a)
b)
MI. MI was claimed in publication EPI and thus, in accordance with Article 67(1)
EPC, enjoys protection as of 06/06/1998.
M2 : M2 was not claimed in publication EPI, which therefore confers no provisional
protection on it (Article 69(2) EPC). The protection is determined by the claims
contained in the publication under Article 93 EPC. M2 will only enjoy the provisional
protection conferred by EP2 on 11/11198.
M3 : M3 was not claimed in applications EPI and EP2, and therefore cannot enjoy
any provisional protection at all. At the earliest, M3 will enjoy the protection
conferred by patent granted on EP2 when the latter is published on 10/05/2001
(Article 64(1) EPC).
MI will enjoy the protection conferred by patent granted on EPI, for up to 20 years
as from the date of filing of EPI, i.e until 12/12/2017 (Article 63(1) EPC)_ M2 will
enjoy the protection conferred by EP2 up to 20 years as from the date of filing of
EP2 (Article 63(1 ) EPC). However, EP2 is a divisional application based on EPI ,
so the date of filing of EP2 is that of EPI (Article 76 EPC). At most, M2 will enjoy
protection up to 12/12/2017. Like M2, M3 will enjoy the protection of patent granted
on EP2, at most up to 12/12/2017 (Articles 63(1) and 76 EPC).
