Section B-VIIIZ 22 in the Guidelines for Examinetion in the EPO applies
mutatis mutandis_
The EPO applies options A9.QZL21 and A9i15[21 of the Appendix to
Chapter 9 of the ISPE Guidelines.
2.2.1 Computer-implemented business methods
As a result of an amendment to the Agreement between the EPO and
WIPO under the PCT, any national or resident of the United States of
America filing an international application on or after 1 January' 2015 with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the 1B as
receiving Office will be able to select the EPO as ISA irrespective of the
technical field in which the application is classified. It should, however, be
noted that the Notice from the EPO dated 1 October 2007 concerning
business methods remains applicable. Therefore, the EPO as ISA will, in all
cases where the subject-matter of the international application involves
technical means, consider the application and to the extent possible
provide a search report for those parts of it which are more than mere
business methods.
Section a-VIII. 22_1 in the Guidelines for Examjnation in the EPO applies

3. No meaningful search possible
The meaning of the word "meaningful" in the context of Alt. is
essentially a matter for the examiner to decide. The examinees finding may
change in the light of any reply from the applicant to the invitation for
informal clarificatiorm if available (see GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3 and 34).
The exercise of the examiner's discretion will depend upon the facts of the
The term "meaningful search" in A1-tiGk should be read to
include a search that within reason is complete enough to determine
whether the claimed invention complies with the substantive requirements,
that is, the novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability requirements,
and/or the sufficiencyq support and clarity requirements of Articles and 6.
Accordingly, a finding of "no meaningful search" should be limited to
exceptional situations in which no search at all is possible for a particular
claim, for example where the description, the claims or the drawings are
totally unclear To the extent that the description, the claims or the drawings
can be sufficiently understood, even though parts of the application are not
in compliance with the prescribed requirements, a search should be
performed recognising that the non-compliance may have to be taken into
account for determining the extent of the search.
As there is no legal provision providing that an applicant must formulate the
application in such a way as to make an economical search possible,
"reasons of economy" cannot be used as a reason, or part of a reason, for
issuing an incomplete search report.
