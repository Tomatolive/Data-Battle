2.10 Subject-matter excluded from search
The examiner may exclude certain subject-matter from the search. These
exclusions may result from the international application including
subject-matter which the EPO as ISA is not required to deal with (see
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII: 2)_ They may also arise because the description,
clams or drawings fail to meet a requirement, such as clarity or support of
the claims by the descriptiorm to such an extent that no meaningful search
can be carried out for all or some of the claims (see
GWPCT-EPO B-VIIIZ 3)_
