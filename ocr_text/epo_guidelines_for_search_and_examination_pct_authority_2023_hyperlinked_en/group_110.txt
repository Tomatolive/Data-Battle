Rule 20.5
However, where the reference does not clearly identify which
subject-matter of the description and/or drawings is to be considered as
included in the claim, the examiner may informally contact the applicant for
clarification before the search is carried out (see GLIPCT-EPO a-VIII, 33).
In the special case of "omnibus claims" (e.g. a claim reading "The invention
substantially as herein described") no request for informal clarification
should be issued, and subsequently the search report will be designated as
complete.
The procedure above should be followed regardless of whether or not the
reference to the drawings and/or the description is allowable according to
Rule 6.2(a).
Where the reference does not appear to be justified, the examiner should
raise an objection in the written opinion.
2.3 Obvious mistakes and missing or correct parts/elements
2.3.1 General considerations
Since there is no right to amend the application until after the intemational
search has been established, the international search must be carried out
on the basis of the search copy of the application as transmitted to the EPO
as ISA by the RO, except that obvious mistakes or formal matters which
are contrary' to the PCT and are called to the applicant's attention by the
RO may be corrected (see also GUPCT-EPO H-IV).
2.3.2 Request for rectification of obvious mistakes (Rule 91)
An applicant can request authorisation to recti'/ obvious mistakes in the
intemational application (see GLIPCT-EPO H-IV, The examiner (if the
request relates to the description, claims or drawings) will have to assess
whether such a request can be authorised according to the criteria set out
in Rule 91
see GUISPE 8_07-808. If RO has erroneously authorised
such rectification, this may affect the search (see GIJPPT-E-PO H-IV, 2,.1)_
If the changes requested by the applicant before the receipt of the ISR are
not rectifications, but rather amendments, the examiner must refuse them,
because there is no right to amend the application until after the
intemational search report has been established. This applies even if the
applicant refers to them as rectifications and even if they would be
allowable amendments not adding subject-matter to the application as
originally filed. For example, reformulation of claims, deletion of technical
terms, deletion or limitation of claims and the taking of subject-matter from
the description into the claims must all be refused at this stage regardless
of whether or not they might be allowable, since they are not rectifications,
but rather substantive amendments.
2.3.3 Incorporating missing parts or elements, or correct parts or
elements, completely contained in the priority document
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire
element(s) thereof (i.e all of the description and/or all of the claims), they
may still fumish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 and Rule 20.6(a) and
