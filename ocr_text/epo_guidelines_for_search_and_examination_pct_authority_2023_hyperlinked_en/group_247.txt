3.5 Withdrawal of priority claims
PCT-EPO Guidelines
The applicant may withdraw a priority claim, made in the international
application under ArtiGl? at any time prior to the expiration of
30 months from the priority date.
3.6 Correction or addition of priority claim
ISPE Guidelines 6.11,
ISPE Guidelines 8.10.
ISPE Guidelines 6.16
and
3.7 Re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period
The applicant may file a request for restoration of the priority right up to two
months after expiry' of the priority year from the claimed priority.
In the international phase, restoration can be granted under both the "due
care" and "unintentional" criteria The EPO as receiving Office and as
designated Office in the regional phase will decide on the basis of the "due
care" criterion (which is the same criterion as used for EP applications with
respect to re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 EPC). If the EPO was
not the receiving Office the request may have been decided upon under
the "unintentional" criterion.
If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the "due care"
criterion, no new request need be filed with the EPO as designated/elected
Office, since the EPO will, in principle recognise the decision of the
receiving Office If, however, the EPO has reasonable doubt that the
requirements for grant were not met, it will notify the applicant accordinglv
In this communication the reasons for such doubt will be indicated and a
time limit will be set within which the applicant may submit comments.
If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the
"unintentional" criterion, a new request needs to be filed with the EPO as
designated/elected Office, since the EPO is not bound by the decision of
any receiving Office under the "unintentional" criterion.
A priority claim may not be considered invalid on the basis that the
international application has an international filing date which is later than
the date on which the priority period expireå provided that the intemational
filing date is within two months of that date. The examiner may make a
remark in the WO-ISA indicating the number of days by which the 12-month
priority period has been exceeded.
For filling out the WO-ISA where the filing date exceeds the earliest priority
date by over twelve months and a further two months, see
GUPCT-EPO 4.1.
