Chapter II-I
Chapter II â€” Content of an international
application (other than claims)
1. General
The contents of the intemational application are set out in Anicle 3(2). The
application must contain:
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
a request;
a description (see GUPCT-EPO F-ll, 4);
one or more claims (see WPC.T.-EPO .EZIV.);
one or more drawings (where required; see GLIPCT-EPO 6-11. 5);
and
an abstract (see GWPCT-EPO F-ll, 2).
This chapter discusses items (ii), (iv) and (v) insofar as they are the
concern of the ISA and 'PEA. Item (v) is dealt with first.
2. Abstract
2.1 Purpose of the abstract
An intemational application must contain an abstract. The abstract merely
serves the purpose of technical information and cannot be taken into
account for any other purpose, particularly not for the purpose of
interpreting the scope of the protection sought.
2.2 Definitive content
The abstract is initially supplied by the applicant subject to the exception
provided for under Rule 382. The examiner conducting the main
international search has the task of determining its definitive contenv which
will normally be published with the application In doing this he should
consider the abstract in relation to the application as filed. If the search
report is published later than the application, the abstract published with the
application will be the one resulting from the procedure referred to in ISPE
Guidelines 1540.
This procedure does not apply to supplementary' international searches for
which the EPO is SISA because the main ISA has already provided the
publication data (see GUPCT-EPO 2).
