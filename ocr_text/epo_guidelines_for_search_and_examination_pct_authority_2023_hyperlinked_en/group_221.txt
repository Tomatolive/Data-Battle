4.8 Industrial applicability
The description should indicate explicitly the way in which the invention is
capable of exploitation in industry', if this is not obvious from the description
or from the nature of the invention (see also GLIPCT-EPQ G-lll). The
expression "capable of exploitation in industry'" means the same as
"susceptible of industrial application". In view of the broad meaning given to
the latter expression in the Appendix to Chapter 14 of the ISPE Guidelines.
and A14_01L21.2, it is to be expected that, in most cases, the
way in which the invention can be exploited in industry' will be self-evident,
so that no more explicit description on this point will be required; but there
may be a few instances, eg_ in relation to methods of testing, where the
manner of industrial exploitation is not apparent and must therefore be
explicitly indicated.
Also, in relation to certain biotechnological inventions, i.e. sequences and
partial sequences of genes, the industrial application is not self-evident and
must be disclosed in the patent application.
