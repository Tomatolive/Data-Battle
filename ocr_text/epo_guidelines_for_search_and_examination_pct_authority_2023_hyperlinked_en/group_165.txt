PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
— Chapter I-I
Chapter I — Introduction
1. General remark
Chapters C-ll to C-IX set out the general procedure for the international
preliminary examination under FCT Chapter together with guidance on
particular matters where necessary. They do not provide detailed
instructions on matters of internal administration.
Matters of substantive law, i_e_ the requirements which a PCT application
must fulfil, are dealt with in Pan F, Pan G and Pan H
2. Work of an examiner
See ISPE Guidelines 3.05.
3. Purpose of international preliminary examination
While the search and the accompanying written opinion under Chapter I are
mandatory for applicants, examination under Chapter II is optional.
The end product of the PCT procedure is the international preliminary
report on patentability (IPRP) Chapter I or Chapter II. This report will be the
result
either of further examination under Chapter II (see below) in the form
of an intemational preliminary examination report (IPER) from the
International Preliminary Examining Authority
or, if no demand under Chapter II is filed, of the International
Bureau's conversion of the WO-ISA into an IPRP of the International
Searching Authority, which is made public at 30 months from the
priority date or shortly thereafter together with any informal
comments submitted by the applicant Such comments will be
annexed to the report Since no demand for preliminary examination
under Chapter II has been filed, there is no re-examination of the
WO-ISA.
In its capacity as an International Preliminary Examining Authority
(i.e. under Qhap.ter..ll Qj..!tle PCT), the EPO is empowered to carry out
international preliminary examination (IPE), the objective of which is to
formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be
industrially applicable. When appropriate an opinion will also be given on
added subject-matteq unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support
issues, as well as formal defects.
The international preliminary examination does not lead to either a grant or
a refusal of a patent; instea4 at the end of the procedure, a report — the
IPRP Chapter II or IPER — is established The procedure under Chapter II
allows the applicant to submit amendments and arguments in response to
the WO-ISA and, if applicable, to a WO-IPEA, which will be taken into
account when establishing the report
