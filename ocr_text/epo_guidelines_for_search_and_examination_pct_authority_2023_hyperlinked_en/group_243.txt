PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part F-
Chapter V-1
Chapter V — Unity of invention
1. Assessment of and reasoning for unity of invention
Given the harmonisation of the definitions concerning unity of invention in
Rules 131 and 132 PCT compared with Art. 82 and Rule 44(1) EPC
respectively, the formal criteria for unity in the EPC and the PCT systems
are the same Hence, search and substantive examination follow the same
principles in both the European and PCT procedures as far as the
reasoning for unity of invention is concerned
As a consequence, the parts relating to the assessment of unity of
invention and its reasoning of GWEPO F-VÄ 1 to F-V, 3 and all subsections
apply mutatis mutandis to the PCT procedure, with the exception of those
passages in GUEPO F--v. and F-vx 321 relating to Rule 4312) EPC_
This is because Rule 43(2) EPC has no equivalent in the PCT, which also
means that, in the PCT procedure multiple independent claims in the same
category need to be considered under the Art 6 conciseness requirement.
Intermediate
documents cited under Rule 33_ I(c) (see
GLIPCT-EPO 3-)C 9.24) are considered in the same way as documents
under Art 5413) EPC (see GLIEPO F-u 3_1) and cannot be used for a non-
unity objection.
This is also the case for novelty-destroying documents cited under
Rule 33. I(a) as accidental anticipation within the meaning of decisions
G 1/03 and G 1/16 of the EPOs Enlarged Board of Appeal (see
GUEPO F--vz 3.12).
2. Lack of unity during search
In many and probably most instances, lack of unity will have been noted at
the search stage. In such caseS a search is conducted for the invention
first mentioned in the claims and the applicant is invited to pay additional
search fees with Form See GWPCT-EPO 2.
See also ISEE-.Gpi#ljnes .1Q_$0 for the process at the international search
stage and IS?E Guidelines 1083 for the process at the supplementary
international search stage
GUEPO 4 applies mutatis mutandis, with the exception of those
aspects already covered above.
3. Lack of unity during the. PPI Ghapk!..l.! procedure
If an invitation to pay additional fees was Issued during Ch?pter I and the
applicant paid some or all of the required additional fees, and if, where
applicable, the objection as to lack of unity was at least partly upheld during
a protest procedure, then under Chapter II the applicant will normally be
invited (using Form 405) to pay additional preliminary examination fees if all
the searched inventions are also to be examined under Chapter IL
Inventions for which no search fees were paid cannot be pursued and will
thus also not be objected to or commented on. See GUPCT-EPO C-V_
