Any E document which is a potential Art 54(3) EPC document will be dealt
with in the Scope Annex. In this case the applicant's attention should be
drawn to the relevance of such a document if the application enters the
European phase before the EPO and a reasoned statement as to lack of
novelty will be given.
9. Copies of documents cited in the SISR
The applicant will receive a copy of each document cited in the SISR free of
charge.
10. Non-unity
10.1 General procedure
In case of non-unity only one invention is searched; there is no possibility to
pay additional fees for further inventions. Furthermore, the decision as to
which invention should be considered the main invention and thus
searched is handled differently for the SIS procedure, as set out in detail in
GWPCT-EPO B-XIIZ 10.2.
Where the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity, the applicant can
indicate together with the supplementary search request which of the
inventions should be searched by the SISA For further details see
GWPCT-EPO B-XII; 10.3.
If on the other hand the main ISA has not objected to lack of unity, the EPO
as SISA is free to do so, as the SISA is not bound by any finding on unity
made by the ISA but merely obliged to take such a finding into account
As for any international search where lack of unity is objected to, the
applicant has the right to protest against the non-unity finding In the SIS
procedure this protest is called a review (see GLIPCT-EPO 10.4).
10.2 Deciding what is to be considered the main invention
The main Invention will normally be the invention first mentioned in the
claims. However, the examiner will exercise due discretion in selecting the
invention to be searched where the first mentioned invention is one for
which no search report would be establishe4 or else where the applicant
has requested that the supplementary search should be limited to one of
the inventions other than the first identified by the ISA responsible for the
main intemational search. For details, see GLIPCT-EPO 10.3.
10.3 The main ISA found that unity of invention is lacking
If the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity and the examiner
agrees with the assessment in the main ISR, this can be reported by simply
referring to the ISR_
If the examiner forms a different point of view, or agrees with a revised view
on unity of invention in a decision relating to a protest before the ISA the
reasoning will be set out in full so that it is easily understood by both the
applicant and third parties. No reasons need be given why the lack-of-unity
objection raised in the ISR could not be followed.
