PCT-EPO Guidelines
Pat B -
Chapter W-l
Chapter VII â€” Unity of invention
1. General remarks
Unity is assessed in the same way in the PCT and European procedures.
However, the consequences of a finding of lack of unity at the search
and/or examination stages are different under the PCT, as are the actions
to be taken by the examiner. In particular, the applicant may be asked to
pay additional search and/or examination fees and may do so under
protest
Furthermore, divisional applications are not allowed under the PCT
2. Lack of unity at the search stage
If the lack of unity finding is raised at the search stage, a search is
conducted for the invention first mentioned in the claims and the applicant
is invited to pay additional search fees with Form PCT/lSA\206 (hereafter
referred to as "Form 206"). The applicant can then decide to:
(iii)
not pay any additional fees,
pay some or all fees without protest or
pay some or all fees under protest.
Art
Rule 13, 40.1
GUISPE 10
OJ EPO 2017, A20
At the same time as completing Form 206, the examiner completes the
provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results (EPO Form
1707) for the searched first invention Form 206 and EPO Form 1707 are
sent together to the applicant The examiner must give a complete and self-
contained reasoning for the lack of unity in EPO Form 1707.
In the case of a doublure (see GLIPCT-EPO B-lV. 1.1) where the earlier
application also lacked unity, the applicant should be invited to pay
additional fees even if all inventions were searched in the earlier
application. The amount refunded will then be decided for each invention
separately.
3. No request for payment of additional search fees
Exceptionally it might be chosen not to request the applicant to pay
additional search fees, even if an objection as to lack of unity occurs. This
could be the case when the additional search effort for the other
invention(s) is minor. In addition, no invitation to pay additional search fees
should be issued when the other inventions are either not novel or do not
possess an inventive step over the prior an at hand. However, it must be
borne in mind that the written opinion under Chapter I must be written for all
inventions that were searched, including those for which no additional
search fees were requested If additional search fees are not requested, for
consistency reasons the examiner should not ask for additional
examination fees should a demand for international preliminary
examination under Chapter II be filed (see GUPCT-EPO C-V, 3.3). Thus,
when deciding on whether to ask for additional search fees, the
examination effort for the whole procedure must also be taken into account.
