Part C
Chapter V-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2023
For information on the exceptional situation of a non-unitary application,
where all inventions examined were found novel and inventive, but still
lacking unity as the only remaining objection, see GWPCT-EPO C-VIII, 3.
2. No payment of additional search fees
If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant
has not paid additional search fees, the WO-IPEA/IPER is based on the
claims for which the search report and the WO-ISA have been drafted
taking amendments and arguments from the applicant into account Section
IV is not filled out.
3. Searched claims did not comply with unity of invention
3.1 Payment of additional search fees without protest
If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant
has paid additional search fees without protest, and the application still
lacks unity, the objection indicated on Form 206 and in the WO-ISA will
normally be confirmed, where necessary adapted to the
amendments/arguments filed by the applicant.
Form 405 is sent out, requesting additional examination fees only for those
inventions which have been searched and which are still present in the
claims.
3.2 Payment of additional search fees under protest
If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant
has paid additional search fees under protest and

(a)
(b)
the Review Panel decided that the protest was fully justified, no
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent. The Review
Panel's decision is followed and the WO-IPEA/IPER is established
for all searched inventions;
the Review Panel decided that the protest was partly justified, an
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent, with the
reasoning and the number of inventions adapted to the Review
Panel's decision.
The examiner should ensure that the lack of unity objection raised at the
search stage is still valid for the newly filed claims.
3.3 No request for payment of additional search fees
If, at the search stage, an objection of lack of unity was raised but
exceptionally it was chosen not to request the applicant to pay additional
search fees, the examination is carried out on the entire application. No
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent; instead, the
WO-IPEA/IPER is established for all searched inventions. Under
Section IV, it is indicated that the requirement of unity is not fulfilled.
