PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C
Chapter W-3
3. Examination of observations by third parties
For details on third-party observations please refer to GLIPCT-EPO E-ll.
For relevant third party observations in Chapter II the following applies
GUISPE 17.59
(b)
If a negative IPER is envisaged and a second written opinion has not
been sent, a WO-IPEA (Form 408) is drafted taking into account the
third-party observations and the applicant's comments where
available, and referring to the new prior-art documents in section V
(see also GUPCT-EPO c-IV. 2_2)_
If the IPER would have been negative even without the third-party
observations and a WO-IPEA has already been sent before receipt of
these observations, no further written opinion is sent before
establishment of the IPER
If a WO-IPEA has already been sent before receipt of the third-party
observations and the IPER would have been positive without the
third-party observations, a new WO-IPEA is issued or the applicant is
called, whichever course of action is considered the more expedient,
in particular in the light of the deadline for issuing the IPER.
In cases (b) and (c) above, the IPER is established taking into account the
third-party observations and the applicant's comments, and referring to the
new documents where appropriate in Section V of the 'PER
If a positive IPER is envisaged since, even though the third-party
observations may refer to more relevant documents than the ones on
file, they do not prejudice novelty and inventive step, the newly cited
relevant documents are dealt with in the reasons in favour of
patentability in Section V on the separate sheet as appropriate.
If the documents are relevant but do not add anything to what was
already available, it is left to the examiner's discretion whether they
need to be quoted in the 'PER For example, in those cases where
the documents are a better starting pont for the problem-solution
approach, examiners may wish to review their argumentation in
support of the positive assessment of inventive step.
Third-party observations which are not relevant or not sufficiently
understandable (see GLIPCT-EPO E-ll for observations not in an EPO
official language) do not need to be dealt with substantially in the WO-IPEA
and/or in the IPER. A comment is included in Section V of the WO-IPEA
and/or in the 'PER indicating that the third-party observations have been
taken into account and found not to be relevant or that the third-party
observations could not be taken into account and why.
