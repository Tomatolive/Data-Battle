In all examples listed above, the examiner may where appropriate
informally invite the applicant to provide clarification of the claimed
subject-matter (see GLIPQT.-E-EQ 3-3).
See ISPE Guidelines 901 and 19-030 for further information.
3.2 Nucleotide and amino acid sequences
If the sequence listing of an intematlonal application is not available or does
not comply with WIPO Standard ST _26 (see Annex C to the Administrative
Instructions, paragraph 4), the EPO as ISA will invite the applicant to
furnish a sequence listing complying with the standard or a translation in
the form of a new sequence listing in a language acceptable to it, as the
case may be, and pay a late fumishing fee, and to perform these steps
within a non-extendable time limit of one month from the date of the
invitation.
If, within the time limit set, the applicant has not submitted an ST.26-
compliant sequence listing and paid the late furnishing fee, the EPO as ISA
will carry out the international search without the sequence listing to the
extent that a meaningful search can be carried out
The examiner when performing the search will either:
issue a declaration under Art and Rule that no
meaningful search on any claimed subject-matter is possible due to
the failure of the applicant to comply with Rule 5.2 (no sequence
listing) and/or Rule 13ter_ 114) (no computer-readable sequence
listing);
issue an incomplete search report with a declaration under
Act. and .l?ter..lßl that a meaningful search is not
possible in respect of certain claimed subject-matter due to the
failure to comply with Rule 52 (no sequence listing) and/or
Rule 13ter.1La) (no computer-readable sequence listing).
This also has consequences for the international preliminary examination
procedure before the EPO as 'PEA (see GUPCT-EPO c-VIII, 21).
3.3 Informal clarification
Where the description, claims or drawings fail to comply with a requirement,
such as clarity or support of the claims by the description, to such an extent
that no meaningful search can be made, the examiner may informally
contact the applicant to clarity specific aspects of the application before the
search is carried out Such informal clarification may help the examiner to
focus the search better It is highly recommended to invite the applicant to
provide such informal clarification before issuing an incomplete ISR or a
declaration of no search. However, there is no legal obligation on the
examiner to use it and no legal consequences in the PCT if the applicant
does not respond An incomplete search report or a declaration of no
search may still be issued without prior clarification.
