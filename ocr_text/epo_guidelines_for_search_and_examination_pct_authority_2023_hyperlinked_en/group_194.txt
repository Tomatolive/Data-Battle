2.1 Sequence listings
March 2023
Where no (complete) international search was carried out because the
applicant did not file an electronic sequence listing conforming to WIPO
Standard ST .26 in response to a request from the ISA or did not pay the
late furnishing fee, the IPER will indicate under Section III that the
examination is limited according to Rule 13ter2 to the same extent as the
search was limited because the applicant failed to comply with (no
sequence listing) and/or .13t% (no computer-readable sequence
listing). The examiner also indicates in Section III of the IPER that the
examination is also limited according to Rule 66.1(e) because the search
was incomplete.
Where a sequence listing in electronic form and compliant with WIPO
Standard ST.26 is not available to the EPO as IPEA, the applicant may be
invited to furnish such a sequence listing under Rule 13ter 114) and to pay
the late fumishing fee under Rule 13ter I(c) within a non-extendable period
of one month from the date of the invitation.
3. Positive or negative 'PER
As for the WO-ISA, the examiner needs to indicate whether the IPER is to
be considered positive or negative. The same criteria apply as in
GWPCT-EPO 3.4.
In the special case of a non-unitary' application, where all inventions
examined (normally after issuance of an invitation to pay additional fees
(Form 405); see WPCT-EPO C-V. 1) were found novel and inventive, but
still lacking unity — as the only remaining objection — the IPER is marked as
negative Under Section a positive statement as to novelty and inventive
step is given for all examined inventions, and the objection as to lack of
unity is reasoned under Section IV
In this special case, the negative IPER can be sent directly without any
further written opinion, as an exception to the general principle outlined
in GUPCT-EPO c-IV: 2_2, that prior to issuing a negative IPER a WO-IPEA
(Form 408) is to be sent The reason for this exception is that the applicant
is entitled to have multiple inventions examined in Chapter II if additional
fees have been paid, so that there is no objection to be raised in the
WO-IPEA.
In the case of a non-unitary application where no additional search fees
were paid and the report on the first invention is positive, the 'PER is also
marked as negative (because the non-unity objection will prevent a direct
grant upon entry into the European phase) and can be sent directly. Under
Section V, a positive statement as to novelty and inventive step is given for
the first invention only. Section IV is
(see GUPCT-EPO C-V. 2).
4. Rectification of the IPER
Since an IPER is a non-binding opinion and not
provides for neither opposition nor appeal against it.
'PER is normally the end of the international
not filled out
a decision, the PCT
