Art 34(2) gives the applicant the right to communicate orally with the
Thus, a request for a telephone conversation from the applicant or the
agent (including those overseas) will be granted, but only after the
subject-matter on which the intemational preliminary examination is to be
based has been clarified, [e. only after the applicant has filed a written
response to the WO-ISA, or, if the international search report has raised an
objection of lack of unity, to an invitation to restrict the claims or to pay
additional fees (Form 405). In that way the subject-matter to be discussed
in the telephone conversation is clarified upfront. Requests for personal
interviews are not granted. However, if a personal interview is requested,
the examiner should inform the applicant by phone that it is the EPOs
policy not to grant personal interviews, but that the matter can be discussed
in the form of a telephone consultation subject to the above condition.

and/or arguments If, in a telephone consultation, the applicant has
expressed the intention not to file further observations/amendments,

further interaction, minutes of the telephone consultation are sent
and these are directly followed up with a negative 'PER. No time limit
is set in the minutes
if, before issuance of the (further) written opinion (Form 408), the
applicant has requested a telephone consultation or altematively a
further written opinion, the examiner has the discretion to decide
which kind of interaction is most suitable for the application in

issuance of the further written opinion but before the date on which
the IPER is established, the request must be granted before a
negative IPER is issued. Howeveq in this case the applicant does not
have the right to file further amendments, unless an agreement has
been explicitly reached (see below).
