PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part
— Chapter Xl-5
examiner immediately realises that the priority is not valid (e.g. in the case
of an alleged doublure (see GLIPCT-EPO B-lVl 1 M) or a continuation-in-
part (see Gl_JPß.T.-EPQ .E.-VI. 1-4)). Also, in case of restoration of priority
rights, the examiner may insert a comment in Box II (see
4.1).
4.1 Restoration of priority
See GLIPCT-EPO F--vc 3.7.
If the examiner notices that the filing date exceeds the earliest priority date
plus twelve and months this may be indicated in the WO-ISA.
4.2 use of "P' documents in the written opinion
If the priority document IS not available, the opinion will be established on
the assumption that the claimed priority is valid. In this case, no comments
need be made regarding 'P" documents but the "P" documents will
nevertheless be indicated under Section VI. For potentially conflicting
patent documents which might give rise to an objection under Art 54(3)
QQ in the European phase, the statements in WPC.T.-EPQ
below regarding "E" documents apply.
If the priority document is available, the examiner will check the validity of
the priority and indicate any negative finding under Section II. Should the
priority be found not to be valid, detailed comments will be made for these
documents with respect to novelty and inventive step of the claimed
subject-matter under Section V, since these documents then become prior
art under Rule 33.1 (a).
Sometimes it is possible for the examiner to determine from the documents
on file that the claimed priority is not valid. An example would be when
during the search a document is found which shows that the priority
document of the searched application is actually not the first application for
the claimed invention.
4.3 use of "E' documents in the written opinion
Although there are no harmonised provisions in the PCT Contracting States
that correspond to Alt 54(3) EPC, such documents will be mentioned
under Section VI if they are considered prejudicial to the novelty of at least
one claim. If the relevance of the document is independent of the priority
being valid or if the priority could be checked and was found invalid,
reasons for the novelty objection will be provided, together with an
indication that such a document would be relevant when entering the
European phase before the EPO
On the other hand, if the document would be relevant under Art 54(3) EPC
only if the priority is not valid, and this could not be checked, then no
reasons need to be given.
5. unity in relation to the written opinion
In the case of lack of unity where more than one invention has been
searched, for each invention searched one independent claim in each
category must be treated in detail.
