PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G
Art. 33111
Chapter II-I
Chapter II — Inventions
1. General remarks
The objective of the international preliminary examination is to formulate a
preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be
industrially applicable.
The PCT does not define what is meant by "invention", but Rules 39 and 67
contain a list of subject-matter for which the ISA or IPEA is not required to
carry out an intemational search or an international preliminary
examination, respectively (see also GLIPCT-EPO B-VIIIZ 2). The
Agreement between the EPO and WIPO in relation to the functioning of the
EPO as an International Authority under the PCT indicates the subject-
matter which the EPO is not required to search or examine, and according
to its Alt. 4 and Annex C the discretion not to search or examine is
exercised by the EPO as ISA and IPEA only to the extent that such
subject-matter is not searched under the provisions of the EPC, specifically
Art 52(2), Art. 52(3), Ait. 531b) and Art. 53(c) EPC
