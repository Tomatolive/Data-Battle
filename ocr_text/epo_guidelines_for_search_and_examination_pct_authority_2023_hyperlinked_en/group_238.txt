4.22 Broad claims
The PCT Regulations do not explicitly mention overly broad claims.
However, objections to such claims may arise for various reasons.
Where there are discrepancies between the claims and the description, the
claims are not sufficiently supported by the description (Art 6) and also, in
most cases, the invention is not sufficiently disclosed (Art 5,
see GUPCT-EPO F-IVL 6.1).
Sometimes an objection of lack of novelty arises, for example if the claim is
formulated in such broad terms that it also covers known subject-matter
from other technical fields Broad claims may also cover embodiments for
which a purported effect has not been achieved. On raising an objection of
lack of inventive step in such cases, see GUPCT-EPO G-VII, 5.2_
4.23 Order of claims
There is no legal requirement that the first claim should be the broadest
However, 6 requires that the claims must be clear not only individually
but also as a whole. Therefore, where there are a large number of claims,
they should be arranged with the broadest claim first. If the broadest of a
large number of claims is a long way down, so that it could easily be
overlooked, the applicant should be required either to re-arrange the claims
in a more logical way or to direct attention to the broadest claim in the
introductory part or in the summary of the description.
Furthermore, if the broadest claim is not the first one, the later broader
claim must also be an independent claim. Consequently, where these
independent claims are of the same categoryq an objection may also arise
under Rule 6 if they result in a lack of clarity and conciseness (see
GWPCT-EPO 3_2)_
5. Conciseness, number of claims
See ISPE Guidelines 5.42.
The EPO applies option GUISPE A5.42L21 of the Appendix to Chapter 5 of
the ISPE Guidelines.
Where it is found that the claims lack conciseness under Art 6, it may be
appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to provide informal
clarification before the search is carried out (see GLI?CT-EPO a-VIII, 33 to
GWPCT-EPO a-VIII, 3_6)_
6. Support in description
6.1 General remarks
