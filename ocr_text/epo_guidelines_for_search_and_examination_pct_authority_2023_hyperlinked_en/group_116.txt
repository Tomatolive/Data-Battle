1.2.1 Requests for PCT Direct
March 2023
PCTA' Part 8
Applicants may request to have their intemational application processed
under PCT Direct by filing a letter ("PCT Direct letter") containing informal
comments aimed at overcoming objections raised in the search opinion
established by the EPO for the priority application. Such informal comments
are to be understood as arguments regarding the patentability of the claims
of the international application and also possibly as explanations regarding
any modifications to the application documents in particular to the claims,
in comparison with the earlier application. PCT Direct letters do not form
part of the international application.
upon receipt of a PCT Direct letter, the intemational application will be
processed under PCT Direct only where the following two requirements are
met
(a) the informal comments are filed together with the international
application with the receiving Office in the form specified in
GUPCT-EPO 1_23 and
(b) the international application claims priority of an earlier application
searched by the EPO (European, national or intemational first filing).
1.2.2 Processing of PCT Direct letters
PCT Direct letters filed With the receiving Office will be transmitted to the
EPO as Intemational Searching Authority and to the International Bureau of
WIPO together with the search copy and record copy, respectively.
At the EPO as International Searching Authority, the examiner performing
the international search will take informal comments filed under PCT Direct
into account when preparing the intemational search report and written
opinion, provided that they meet the requirements (a) and (b) listed in
GL/PCT-EPO B-l\.q 1.21 and that they are in the form specified in
GWPCT-EPO 1.2
The written opinion will reflect this by acknowledging the PCT Direct letter
and addressing its content insofar as it is relevant to the international
search procedure. The examiner, howeveq may make explicit reference to
the earlier search opinion only if it is annexed to the PCT Direct letter.
In accordance with the PCT provisions on file inspection, PCT Direct letters
will be available to the public on WIPO's PATENTSCOPE.
1.3 Third-party observations
For general Information on third-party observations in the PCT phase, see
GWPCT-EPO E-li_
If the formalities officer forvvards third-pany observations to the examiner
before a final report (ISR, SISR or 'PER) is establishe4 the examiner
should consider them in the same way as in the European procedure (see
GL/EPO E-Vlö 3)_ However, given that under the PCT third-pany
observations should refer to novelty or inventive step only, their relevance
will in most cases depend on the relevance of the prior-art documents in
