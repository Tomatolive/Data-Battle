If the application is severely deficient and it is clear that the claims will have
to be drastically redrafted anyway, it is not necessary to make objections
with respect to minor clarity issues and/or formal issues
3.3 Making suggestions
It is possible to make suggestions in the written opinion as to how certain
objections raised may be overcome. However, examiners must not actually,
of their own volition, make any final amendments to the application
documents, however minor, for the reason that only amendments submitted
by the applicant may be taken into consideration for the IPER_ In no
circumstances should the impression be given that compliance with the
suggestions would lead to an allowable application under the EPC or any
national law
If no demand for Chapter II is filed, the WO-ISA will automatically be
converted into an IPRP Chapter l. Therefore, the WO-ISA should not
contain formulations suggesting to the applicant to actively file submissions.
3.4 Positive or negative WO-ISA
The examiner needs to indicate whether the WO-ISA is to be considered
positive or negative for further prosecution. The reason for this is that when
entering the European phase the applicant is required to respond to the
WO-ISA if it is negative, but not if it is positive (see GLIEPO E-IX, 3.3.2)_
As a general rule, a WO-ISA is considered positive if it contains no
objections at all or only minor objections which would not hinder a direct
grant in the EP phase
In the special case where the search report cites P and/or E documents but
the priority could not be checked and there are no other objections, the
WO-ISA is considered positive (since the examiner in the European phase
first has to evaluate the validity of the priority and then decide whether a
grant is still possible).
On the other hand, if the relevance of the document is independent of the
priority being valid, detailed reasons for the novelty objection will be given,
as well as an indication to the applicant that such a document would be
relevant when entering the European phase before the EPO
In the case of method of treatment claims which can easily be reformulated
into an allowable format (see also GLIPCT-EPO B-VIII, 21), the above
applies as well; i.e. if this is the only objection, the WO-ISA will be
considered positive since such a reformulation can be done by the
examiner at the grant stage in the European phase before the EPO
In the special case of a non-unitary' application, where all inventions
searched were found to be novel and inventive, but still lacking unity — as
the only objection — the WO-ISA is marked as negative.
4. Priority claim and the WO-ISA
Normally, priority need only be checked if a relevant P or E document is
found during the search. However, there may also be cases where the
