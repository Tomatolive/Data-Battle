Art. and
Applicants sometimes file a request for examination of cenain claims only
without actually restricting the set of claims, e.g. in order to achieve a
positive IPER although the findings for some claims would be negative An
example would be where in reply to the WO-ISA which contained a
negative opinion on claims 1-5 and a positive one on claims 6 and 7, the
applicant does not change the claims but asks that the IPER be established
for claims 6 and 7 only.
A request for examination of certain claims only is not accepted since the
'PER is established on the claims on file and can only be restricted by the
examiner, e.g on the grounds of lack of unity with not all fees paid,
unsearched claims clarity or added subject-matter. A restriction at the
request of the applicant would be contrary to Art 35(2), which states that
the IPER relates to "each In such a case the applicant is informed
that unless a restricted set of claims is filed the IPER will be established for
all claims.
4. Complaint against the findings at the search stage
If the search was restricted and the applicant complains about the findings
at the search stage, the complaint will be dealt with by the Complaint
Handling unit at the EPO_
In order to ensure that a submission is treated as a complaint, applicants
are advised to use the online complaint form and explicitly state that their
reply is to be considered as a complaint A letter of reply in which an
applicant submits only substantive counterarguments contesting the
findings of the ISA is not a complaint (see also GUPCT-EPO C-IV, 4.1)_
While there is no provision for a review based on substantive arguments
the ISA may exceptionally have to issue a corrected ISR in the event of a
procedural flaw.
