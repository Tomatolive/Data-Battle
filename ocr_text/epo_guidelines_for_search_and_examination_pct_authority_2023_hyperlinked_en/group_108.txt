standard as for a European application in so far as the same requirements
are examined.
There is no difference between an intemational and a European search,
either in respect of the method and thoroughness of the search or in
respect of the sources of prior an searched.
2. Objective of the search
The objective of the intemational search is to discover the prior art which is
relevant for the purpose of determining novelty and inventive step The
intemational search as such, thus, does not differ from a European search.
3. Search documentation
Section B-ll, 3 in the Guidelines for Examinatipn in the SPO applies mutatis
mutandis
4. Search report
An international search report is prepared containing the results of the
search, in particular by identifying the documents constituting the relevant
state of the art (see GUPCT-EPO B-x. 9).
The search report is accompanied by a written opinion of the Intemational
Searching Authority (see GWPCT-EPO B-XI)_
5. Time limit
The time limit for establishing the international search report and the
WO-ISA is three months from the receipt of the search copy by the ISA or
nine months from the priority date, whichever occurs later. In practice this
means that the search and the written opinion should be established no
later than 16 months from the priority date.
