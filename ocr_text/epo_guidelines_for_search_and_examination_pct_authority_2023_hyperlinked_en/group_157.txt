Chapter XII-5
If the examiner finds that the application does not lack unity, a complete
search is made for all the claims No reasons need be given why the lack-
of-unity objection raised in the ISR could not be followed.
Furthermore, if the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity, the
applicant can indicate, on the supplementary search request form (in
Box which of the inventions searched by the main ISA the SIS should
be based upon.
If the examiner agrees with the assessment of unity of invention made by
the main ISA and the relevant claims are not excluded for any reason, the
SIS will focus on the invention indicated by the applicant
If examiners cannot follow the objection raised in the ISR, but raise a
different non-unity objection, when deciding on the main invention to be
searched, they will take the request by the applicant into account as far as
possible. The examiner will provide complete reasoning for the lack-of-unity
objection in the SISR and will include an explanation of the extent to which
the applicant's request could be taken into account in view of the different
non-unity objection raised by the EPO_
10.4 Review procedure
If applicants do not agree with the finding of lack of unity they can request a
review of this finding. This procedure is similar to the protest procedure with
the difference that additional fees cannot be paid.
If applicants request a review of the non-unity finding they must pay a
review fee If no fee is paid, the request for review is considered not to have
been made.
Similar to the protest procedure, a Review Panel is established consisting
of the examiner responsible for the file an examiner as chairperson of the
Review Panel and a further examiner. This Review Panel will, in case of
entry into the European phase, constitute the Examining Division (see
GLIPCT-EPO a-VII, 72). The examiner dealing with the file will make a first
assessment of the arguments made by the applicant and will then discuss
the case with the members of the Review Panel to come to a decision.
The purpose of the Review Panel is to determine whether the lack-of-unity
objection was justified on the basis of the reasoning given in the SISR_ The
review does not include re-evaluation to determine possible additional
grounds for lack of unity.
Where the Review Panel determines that the objection was not justified, it
will inform the applicant with Form 503; no reasoning needs to be given.
Furthermore, it will order the reimbursement of the review fee. A corrected
SISR must then be established on all claims.
If the Review Panel considers that the objection is completely or partially
justified, it will communicate this to the applicant with Form 503. In these
cases, reasoning must be given indicating why the objection is (at least
partially) upheld. This reasoning should also address the applicant's
