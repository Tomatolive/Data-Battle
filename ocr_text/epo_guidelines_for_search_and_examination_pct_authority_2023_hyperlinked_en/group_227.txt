Part F
— Chapter III-I
Chapter Ill — Sufficiency of disclosure
1. Sufficiency of disclosure
A detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention must
be given Since the application is addressed to the person skilled in the art,
it is neither necessary nor desirable that details of well-known ancillary
features should be given, but the description must disclose any feature
essential for carrying out the invention in sufficient detail to render it
apparent to the skilled person how to put the invention into practice. A
single example may suffice, but where the claims cover a broad field, the
application should not usually be regarded as satisfying the requirements of
Art 5 unless the description gives a number of examples or describes
alternative embodiments or variations extending over the area protected by
the claims. However, regard must be had to the facts and evidence of the
particular case There are some instances where even a very broad field is
sufficiently exemplified by a limited number of examples or even one
example (see also GLIPCT-EPO F-IV_L 6.3). In these latter cases the
application must contain, in addition to the examples, sufficient information
to allow the person skilled in the art, using common general knowledge, to
perform the invention over the whole area claimed without undue burden
and without needing inventive skill. In this context, the hvhole area claimed"
is to be understood as substantially any embodiment falling within the ambit
of a claim, even though a limited amount of trial and error may be
permissible, e.g. in an unexplored field or when there are many technical
difficulties.
With regard to Art. 53 an objection of lack of sufficient disclosure
presupposes that there are serious doubts, substantiated by verifiable
facts. See also GUPCT-EPO F-1112 4.
For the requirements of Art. 5 and of Rule and to be fully
satisfied, it is necessary that the invention is described not only in terms of
its structure but also in terms of its function unless the functions of the
various parts are immediately apparent. Indeed in some technical fields
(ege computers), a clear description of function may be much more
appropriate than an over-detailed description of structure
In cases where it is found that an application is sufficiently disclosed
according to Alt 5 only in respect of a part of the claimed subject-matter, it
may be appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to provide
informal clarification before the search is carried out (see
GUPCT-EPO 3.3-3.6)_

If the claims for a perpetual motion machine are directed to its function, and
not merely to its structure, an objection arises not only under Art. 5 but also
