PCT-EPO Guidelines
Chapter VI — The state of the art at the search
stage
1. General
The general considerations relating to the state of the art with regard to the
determination of novelty and inventive step are set out in
GUPCT-EPO G-IV.
2. State of the art — oral disclosure, etc.
According to Rule 331(a) and Rule 33.1(b), oral disclosure, use, exhibition,
etc are recognised as prior ait only when this is substantiated by a written
disclosure, contrary to Art. 54
See also ISPE Guidelines 11.22 and 15.05.
Where a non-written disclosure occurs and both the non-written disclosure
and the written account of it are published before the relevant date as
defined in Rule 641(b), the examiner will cite the written account in the
search report and give the date of the written disclosure on the search
report. In this case, the written disclosure constitutes the prior art
If the written disclosure was made available to the public on or after the
filing date of the international application concerned, the written disclosure
will be cited in the international search report together with the date on
which it was available, provided that the non-written disclosure was made
available to the public prior to the filing date of the international application.
The written opinion and the international preliminary examination report will
draw attention to the non-written disclosure in Box No. VI (Certain
documents cited).
Where a non-written disclosure occurs but is not followed by any written
account, it is not cited in the international search report, because it is not
considered to be state of the art under the PCT. The examiner makes a
note of this non-written disclosure and will reconsider its status if the
application enters the European phase before the EPO (see GUEPO
3. Priority
Section B-VL 3 jn the Guidelines for Examination in _the EPO applies
mutatis mutandis
4. Conflicting applications
4.1 Potentially conflicting European and international applications
Generally, where the intemational search is concluded less than eighteen
months after the international filing date of the application, it will not be
possible at the time of the search to make a complete search for potentially
conflicting European and international applications. This search therefore
has to be completed during the mandatory top-up search if a demand under
Ghap.ter.ll WT. has been made (see GI_/PQ.T.-EPQ Q-IV, 5) or altematively
