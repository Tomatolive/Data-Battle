2.1 Applications containing missing parts or elements, or correct
parts or elements, incorporated by reference
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire
element(s) thereof (i.e all of the description and/or all of the claims), they
may still fumish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international
filing date, subject to the requirements of 4-1? and auk.2Q.ß(a) and
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) completely
contained in the priority document
Similarly, if applicants appear to have erroneously filed part(s) of the
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (i.e all of the description
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date,
subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 206(a) and provided the
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority
document
The activity of the EPO as ISA depends on the decisions taken by the RO
with regard to the intemational application and its filing date; see also
GL/PCT-EPO A-II* 6. Therefore, in cases where the international
application was corrected by the RO under Rule 20.5bis, the EPO as ISA
will establish the written opinion on the basis of the intemational application
including the correct element(s) and/or part(s) if:
(a)
(b)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) before the
start of the search; or
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the
stan of the search (including after its completion) and the applicant
pays an additional fee equal to the search fee within one month of
the date of the invitation to do so issued by the EPO (Rule 40bis.1
and Article 211) RFees) (see GLIPCT-EPO B-lll,_
See GUPCT-EPO 8-111.23.3.
The examiner must check (as far as the documents needed are available)
whether the RO'S assessment of the "completely contained" criterion was
correct (see GUPCT-EPO H-IIL 2.2_2)_ See also GUPCT-EPO 8-111223.3
and GIJPCT-EPO H-llz 2_2.22, for the impact on the search report and
WO-ISA_
2.2 Applications filed in Dutch
The EPO acting as ISA accepts intemational applications drawn up in
Dutch if the application was filed with the Netherlands patent office as RO_
Therefore, for such files, a translation is not required for the purpose of the
intemational search by the EPO as ISA. However, under
within 14 months of the priority date, a translation must be filed with the RO
in a language of publication accepted by the RO for the purpose of
intemational publication, i.e. English, French or German in the case of the
Netherlands patent office as RO_ The EPO as ISA will establish the ISR
and WO-ISA in that language if it is already known at the time of carrying
