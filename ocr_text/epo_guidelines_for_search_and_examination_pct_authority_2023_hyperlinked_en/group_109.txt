Rule 34
— Chapter Ill-I
Chapter Ill — Characteristics of the search
1. Scope of the search
1.1 Completeness of the search
The scope of the international search is defined in Alt. 15(4), stipulating
that the International Searching Authority must endeavour to discover as
much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit and must, in any case,
consult the documentation specified in the PCT Regulations (Rule 34). It
follows from this definition ("as its facilities permit") that the scope of an
international search is equivalent to that of a European search.
International and European searches are thus fully identical in scope.
