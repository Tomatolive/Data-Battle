PCT-EPO Guidelines
2.11 Nucleotide and amino acid sequences
If, after an invitation from the EPO as ISA according to Rule 13tert the
applicant has not submitted the sequence listing in the required format (in
XML and complying with WIPO Standard ST .26) and in an accepted
language and paid the late furnishing fee within the time limit sev the EPO
as ISA will carry' out the international search without the sequence listing to
the extent that a meaningful search can be carried out (see also
GUPCT-EPO a-VIII. 3.2).
If, in addition to an ST.26-compliant sequence listing, another sequence
listing is also filed in another format accepted for the filing of documents,
only the sequence listing complying with ST _26 will be taken into account
when searching the application.
2.12 Lack of unity
When the claims of the international application do not relate to one
invention only, or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single
general inventive concept, the applicant will normally be invited to pay
additional search fees. If the applicant does not pay any additional search
fees in response to the invitation, the international search will norrnally be
restricted to those parts that relate to the invention, or so linked group of
inventions, first mentioned in the claims. If additional fees have been paid
within the prescribed time limit, those parts that relate to the inventions
covered thereby are also searched See also GLIPCT-EPO B-VII.
