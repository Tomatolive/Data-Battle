Chapter Ill — Documents forming the basis of
the international preliminary examination
1. Substitute sheets and rectified sheets
Replacement pages or sheets, filed in response to an invitation by the
receiving Office to correct defects in the international application, are
deemed to be part of the international application "as originally filed". These
sheets are identified with a stamp "SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)" (see
GLIPQT-EPO hl-lV. 1). Also, replacement pages or sheets for rectification
of obvious mistakes under Rule 91 are deemed to be part of the
international application "as originally filed". These sheets are identified
with "RECTIFIED SHEET (see 22).
See GUPCT-EPO H-IV. 2, for the procedure to follow if the rectified sheets
contain added subject-matter.
2. Sheets filed under containing missing parts or elements
or correct parts or elements
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire
element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description and/or all of the claims) they
may still furnish it (them) at a later date without affecting the intemational
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rules 418 and 20.6(a) and
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained
in the priority document.
Similarly, if applicants appear to have erroneously filed (a) part(s) of the
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (ie_ all of the description
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date,
subject to the requirements of Rules 418 and 20.6(a) and provided the
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority
document.
Such elements and/or parts are then considered to have been part of the
application as originally filed, provided that they were notified to the ISA on
2.3_4, and 2.1_
The examiner checks whether the ROS assessment of the "completely
contained" criterion was correct (see GLIPCT-EPO I-I-IL 22.2).
See also GLIPCT-EPO H-lk for the impact on the IPER.
