Chapter IV — Search procedure and strategy
1. Analysis of the application prior to searching
1.1 Taking into account results of an earlier search and
classification
Applicants may request the ISA to take any earlier searches into account,
including searches not carried out by the EPO
It may happen that the PCT application to be searched by the EPO as ISA
is a "doublure" of a previous application. A later filed application is
considered as a doublure when (i) the search report for the first application
is issued by the EPO, (ii) the earlier application is claimed as priority (iii)
this priority claim is valid, and (iv) the later search report can at least partly
be based on a search report of the earlier application.
Where the EPO can base the ISR on an earlier search that it has
performed on an application whose priority is validly claimed for the
international application, the intemational search fee paid will be refunded
in part or in full depending upon the extent to which the EPO benefits from
that earlier search. No refund is made if priority has not been validly
claimed (see also GUPCT-EPO A-Ill.. 9_2)_
A request to take into account an earlier search not made by the EPO has
no impact on the work of the examiner, who will do an independent full-
scope international search However, the documents cited in the earlier
search report (which will be available in the file) might be useful. No refund
is made for an earlier search that was not carried out by the EPO itself.
For intemational applications filed on or after 1 July 2017, in carrying out
the international the EPO as ISA may take earlier search results
into account where the applicant makes a request to that effect under
Rule 4_1? as well as in the cases envisaged under Rule 412 This means
that the EPO as ISA will also be able to take earlier search and
classification results into account where the intemational application claims
the priority of one or more earlier applications in respect of which an earlier
search has been carried out by the EPO, or where the RO has transmitted
to the EPO as ISA a copy of the results of any earlier search or of any
earlier classification under Rule or (b) or where such a copy is
available to the EPO as ISA in a form and manner acceptable to it.
1.2 PCT Direct applications
Under PCT Direct, an applicant filing an intemational application claiming
priority from an earlier national, European or international application
already searched by the EPO (i.e. a
"doublure";
GLIPCT-EPO B-lVl 1.1) is able to react to any objections raised in the
search opinion drawn up for the priority application. This simplifies the
assessment of the international application and adds to the value of the
international search report and written opinion established by the EPO
