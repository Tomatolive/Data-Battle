PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B
â€” Chapter 111-3
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained
in the priority document.
Similarly if applicants appear to have erroneously filed part(s) of the
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (ie_ all of the description
and/or all of the claims), they may still fumish the correct part(s) and/or
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date
subject to the requirements of Rules 418 and and provided the
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority
document (see GUPCT-EPO A-II,_ 6)_
The activity of the EPO as ISA depends on the decisions taken by the RO
with regard to the international application and its filing date; see also
GLIPCT-EPO A-II, 6. Therefore in cases where the international
application was corrected by the RO under Rule 20.5bis, the EPO as ISA
will carry out the search on the basis of the intemational application
including the correct element(s) and/or part(s) if:
(a)
(b)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) before the
start of the search; or
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the
start of the search (including after its completion) and the applicant
pays an additional fee equal to the search fee within one month of
the date of the invitation to do so issued by the EPO (Rule 40bis.1
and Article 41) RFees) (see GUPCT-EPO 23.4).
The examiner checks whether the ROS assessment of the "completely
contained" criterion was correct (see GL/PCT-EPO H-llz 2_22). If the RO
erroneously considered that the missing part(s) and/or element(s), or
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority
document, the search should be extended to include documents which
would be relevant if the application were to be redated (such documents
can be cited as "L" in the ISR)_
See also GLIPCT-EPO 2.1.
2.3.4 Correct elements or parts notified after the start of the search
and additional fee
The RO may notify the ISA of correct part(s) and/or element(s) after the ISA
has begun to draw up the intemational search report In such cases, the
EPO as ISA will invite the applicant to pay an additional fee equal to the
search fee within one month of the date of the invitation (Form 208)
(Rule 40bis.1 and Article 211) RFees)_
If the EPO as ISA is notified of correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the
search has started but before its completion and the additional fee is paid,
the EPO will also complete the already initiated search and issue a
non-offcial international search report and written opinion based on the
international application as initially submitted However, the non-official
international search report and written opinion are issued only for the
benefit of the applicant and any designated Offices which have given notice
