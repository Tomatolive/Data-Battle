Chapter II-I
1. Intemational search and written opinion under
The procedure through which a PCT application proceeds from the filing of
the application to the conclusion of the international phase comprises the
international search and written opinion under Chapter l, which is
mandatory for applicants, and the international preliminary examination
under Chapter II, which is optional.
The objective of the international search is to discover the prior art which is
relevant for the purpose of determining whether, and if so to what extent,
the claimed invention to which the international application relates is or is
not novel and does or does not involve an inventive step. The result of the
search is communicated to the applicant in the form of an international
search report In some cases the Intemational Searching Authority is not
required to establish a search for some or all of the claimed subject-matter,
e.g. because more than one invention is claimed or the application covers
excluded subject-matter
In its capacity as an Intemational Searching Authority, the EPO is
empowered not only to carry out the intemational search but also to
formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be
industrially applicable When appropriate an opinion will also be given on
added subject-matter, unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support
issues, as well as formal defects.
This opinion is sent to the applicant in the form of a written opinion of the
International Searching Authority (WO-ISA) together with the search report
If no intemational preliminary examination report is to be established
because the applicant did not file a demand for preliminary' examination, or
the demand has been withdrawn, the International Bureau will prepare a
report, entitled "intemational preliminary report on patentability (Chapter I of
the Patent Cooperation Treaty)" having the same contents as the written
opinion. Even if the applicant filed any amendments under Article 19, the
amendments will not be taken into consideration in the international
preliminary report on patentability (PCT Chapter l).
The written opinion (and any informal comments filed by the applicant) will
be made available to the public by the International Bureau at the same
time as the international publication.
The EPO is an International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authority
for the vast majority of PCT contracting states. All applications are treated
in the same manner irrespective of their country of origin.
Although the PCT procedure differs in some procedural and formal aspects
from the European procedure, the criteria for search and examination with
respect to novelty, inventive step, industrial applicabilityq unity non-
patentable subject-matter or exclusions, insufficient disclosure and clarity
are in principle the same. This means that search and examination under
the PCT is carried out in the same way and applying the same quality
