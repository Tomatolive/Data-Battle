accelerated grant must be retracted and the examner must be advised of the
existence of NF-EU2 and NF-lE2. Oral proceedings should be requested and/or
a separate set of claims should be filed. Amended claims on B-EUI can be filed.
For IE and those countries for which the designation fees have been paid, such
amended claims should be directed to the use of blottanes as moisture absorbent
materials and to product X; for the other countries, the claims should additionally
include product claims to blottanes in general. As the European Patent Office
will not knowingly grant an invalid patent, the examiner will resume examination
if material pror art is brought to his attention.
In any event, NE-EUI does not constitute prior art for B-EUI. NF-EU2 does
not appear to prejudice claims to product X in B-EUI and claims to composts
containing blottanes in B-EU2 since these clams are new over NF-EU2.
For the reasons given above for NE-EUI , B-EUI could if amended have
valid claims to the use of blottanes for their moisture-absorbent properties.
Even if the same invention is covered by NE-EUI and B-EU1/B-EU2, each
applicant will get their patent
Boggy should file a new application for woven X as a shoe liner.
Filing translations to obtain provisional protection under national law should
be considered.
Could the Niffv patents cause us anv problems in exploitinq blottanes in the
EPC contracting States?
There is a potential risk that the claims of NF-EU2 will be amended to blottanes
in general. Whether or not the designation fees are paid for NF-EU2, Niffy
(through NF-IEI and NF-EUI) may get a patent granted directed to the use of
blottanes as moisture absorbent materials which covers the uses of blottanes
intended by Boggy and the licensees . A patent does not give a right to exercise
the claimed invention, only the right to stop others. Therefore, such a patent
granted on NF-IEI/NF-EUI could be used to stop Boggy even though Boggy
would have a patent of the same priority date as NE-EUI . However, possible prior
knowledge defences should be taken into account according to national law.
What action can we take to stop Niffy using blottanes in the EPC contracting
States?
B-EUI could be used to stop Niffy exercising their invention since B-EUI claims
blottanes. If the designation fees on NF-EU2 are paid and/or in view of NF-lE2,
there could be problems in exelting B-EUI as it would be paftially invalid.
However, if B-EUI were restricted to use claims (use for moisture absorbent
properties) then it could still be used to stop Niffy using blottanes for their moisture
absorbent properties for the same reasons as given above. However, Niffi,' could
not be stopped from using blottanes for other purposes.
