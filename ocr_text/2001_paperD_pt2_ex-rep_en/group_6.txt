Can we validly file such a European divisional application based on B-EUI
or B-EU2?
B-EU2 has no disclosure in the application as filed of the use of blottanes in
nappies nor of the product k Therefore, a divisional based on this subject matter
cannot be filed.
If a divisional has to be filed it will have to be from B-ELJT However, the approval
of the text of B-EUI has been filed and so filing a divisional is normally no longer
possible However we cannot retract our approval in reply to the R. 51 (4)
communication simply because it is too late to file a divisional. Therefore the
procedure mentioned above should be adopted to draw NF-ElJ2 and/or NF-lE2
to the examiner's attentiom It should be checked, close to the due date, whether
NF-IE2 has been published or whether the designation fees have been paid for
NF-EU2. If neither of these actions has occurred, then we can pay, on or close to
the last day, at least one designation fee for NF-EU2 — with the surcharge — for a
country covered by B-EUI . This Will force the examiner to consider NF-ElJ2_
It is noted that the EPO will accept payment from anyone Earlier payment might
encourage Niffy to pay the remaining fees, so we should pay late to reduce this
risk.
If possible, an unimportant country should be selected. Examination will be
resumed and should result in a fresh R 51(4) communicatiom Once examination
has been resumed, a divisional from B-EUI claiming disposable nappies
containing product X can be filed.
Can Niffv stop us from supplyinq Feuchtfurcht in the EPC contractinq
States?
Niffy may obtain rights, through NF-EUI/NF-IEI, in the use of blottanes as
moisture-absorbent material and may obtain rights, through NF-EU2/NF-lE2 for
blottanes in general or at least for woven blottanes, because continuous fibres are
necessary for making woven materials. In that case a licence from Niffy would be
needed. Cross licensing would seem to be a practical solution. Notably, Niffy may
be interested in product X for its odour-absorbing properties and so a potential for
agreement exists. Otherwise acquisition of Niffy or acquisition of patents from
Niffy would also be a solution.
