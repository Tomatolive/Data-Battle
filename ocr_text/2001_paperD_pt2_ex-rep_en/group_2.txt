possibilities for Niffy and Boggy in terms of preventing each other from exploiting the
various aspects of blottanes, since such candidates did not have a clear picture of the
potential patent rights of the two companies. In this connection, it appears that a
detailed time line having information about applications, claims, disclosures and dates
would be of great help to gain a correct overview of the situatiom
A number of candidates in reply to question 4 explained how to stop Niffy obtaining a
patent instead of explaining how to stop Niffy using blottanes.
A surprising number of candidates considered that a patent gives the right to exercise
an invention and not the right to stop others from doing so. In panicular, it was often
not realised that a patent for a specific item such as product X does not give a right to
exploitation when another (broader) patent covers the subject-matter in question.
Many also did not set out that when two companies hold patents of the same date for
the same invention, as for B-EUI and NE-EUI with respect to moisture absorption,
neither company can exploit without licence from the other.
In this connection it is also to be noted that many candidates at various points
suggested cross licences as a solution to problems without indicating with reasoning
precisely what the contents of such licences should be.
Most candidates correctly analysed the pure formal status of the various applications
in the paper. In particular, most noted that the designation fees for NF-EU2 are still
payable with a surcharge and the possible consequences of invalidity for the general
claims to blottanes in B-EUI in view of NF-EU2 being potential prior art under Article
54(3) EPC.
Most candidates saw that the desired divisional application can not be filed with
B-ElJ2 as a parent, since this divisional application itself does not include the desired
matter
Most candidates also saw the complications when trying to use the B-EUI as a
parent, since B-EUI stands immediately before grant having completed the
procedures under Rule 51 (4 and 6) EPC A large number of candidates unfortunately
gave up at this point, without seeing the possibility of quickly introducing NF-EU2 to
the examiner to justify reopening of the procedure of B-EIJI, both to enable the valid
filing of the desired divisional application and to improve the claims in the parent
application.
