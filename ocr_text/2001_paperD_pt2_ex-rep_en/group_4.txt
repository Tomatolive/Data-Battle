other than product A are of no practical use may cause problems if Niffy seek to
broaden the claims of NF-EU2_
In any event, NE-EUI is not entitled to its priority claim for any subject matter that
was in NF-EU2 (and NF-lE2), since NF-IEI was not the first application for such
matter. Claims to the use of blottanes for their moisture absorbent properties are
entitled to the priority of NF-IEI
Since NF-EU2 was published before the filing date of NF-EUI, NF-EU2 is
available as prior art both for novelty and inventive step for that subject matter in
NE-EUI which is not entitled to the priority claim.
Since NF-EU2 was published after the filing date of NF-IEI , NF-EU2 is not novelty
destroying prior an for those claims in NE-EUI directed to the use of blottanes for
their moisture absorbent properties. Both B-EUI (from B-GBI) and NE-EUI (from
NF-IEI) have the same date and earliest priority date for the use of blottanes for
their moisture-absorbent properties. Thus, NE-EUI and B-EU1/B-EU2 are not
prior art against each other for the use of blottanes as moisture-absorbent
materials.
NE-EUI therefore has patentable subject matter in claims relating to the use of
blottanes for their moisture absorbing properties and appears to have patentable
subject matter for the use of blottanes for moisture-absorbent shoe linings.
Could vou advise us whether the subiect matter of B-EUI and B-EU2 is
patentable in the EPC contracting States in view of the Niffy applications?
If not, is there any action we can take to improve our position?
NF-EU2 was published after the priority date of B-EUI (from B-GBI) and so is
only available as prior art for novelty and not for inventive step for those countries
in which designation fees are paid. If the designation fees of NF-EU2 are not
paid then B-EUI can have claims to blottanes in general; if designation fees of
NF-EU2 are paid then B-EUI cannot have claims to blottanes in general for
those countries in which the designation fees have been paid.
In IE there may be a conflict because of NF-lE2_ Therefore a separate set of
claims should be considered for IE
If a patent is granted and not opposed, the claims cannot be amended centrally
to use claims which would be valid and amendments would have to be carried
out nationally for those countries that permit this. If an opposition is filed, then
amendments will be possible during the opposition procedure.
To improve our position, it would be helpful if we could delay the grant to see
whether the fees are paid on NF-EU2. Grant cannot normally take place less than
5 months after the R 51(6) notice but in this case rapid grant has been asked for
and this may mean a waiver of the five month temm
Therefore, the examiner must be contacted as soon as possible, the request for
