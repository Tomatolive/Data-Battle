Both fees should be paid to the EPO as PEA
According to Art 34(2)(c) PCT the applicant will get at least 1 written opinion from the
IPEA unless the application complies with all requirements, however the written opinion
of the search authority will be considered to be the written opinion of the exam authority
(R66_ 1 bis(a) PCT), so if no amendments are filed in response to this written opinion, the
International exam report will be the same as the written opinion.
Therefore the applicant should file reasoned arguments and amendments under
Art 34 PCT if appropriate, in response to the objections raised in the written opinion,
directly to the EPO, at the same time as filing the demand, indicating that the response
is for the purpose of the Chapter II examination procedure.
Question 6
No. Under Art 59 EPC it is possible to have different proprietors for different states.
Under R52 EPC, patent is granted to each applicant accordingly. According to
Art 118 EPC, where the proprietors are not the same for all designated states, they shall
be regarded as joint proprietors for all proceedings before the EPO, and the text of the
patent shall be uniform for all states, unless othemise provided for in the EPC
This also applies in opposition proceedings (T272/95)_
The only exceptions to this unity requirement are where there are different European or
national prior rights for different states, where a 3rd palty is judged to be partially entitled
to the application under Art 61EPC, or where states have reservations (no longer
applicable). None of these exceptions apply in this case so far as we know:
Different European prior rights for different states under Art 54(3), (4) and R23a may be
raised in opposition under Art 100(a) EPC but this could only give different claims for
Austria only if the prior European rights applied only to
Austria, or to all states except Austria Prior national rights are not a ground
under Art 100 EPC
A and B agreed to share the application, so the entitlement exception also
does not apply.
Therefore cannot pursue different sets of claims (unless European prior rights
makes Austria an exception as discussed).
