However, apart from amendments, in written proceedings before the EPO any palty may
use any official language (RI(I) EPC), such as English (Art 14(1) EPC)_
So attorney (for client) may use English for any other written document then
amendments and so may the EPO (however if the EPO is to use English, the applicant
must agree J18/90)_
b) Under R2(1) EPC any party to oral proceedings can use any official language
provided gives EPO notice at least 1 month before oral proceedings or makes provision
for interpretation into language of proceedings. Therefore attorney/client can use English
with warning or translation into French.
The EPO can also use English (R2(2) EPC) as a different official language, but must
arrange and pay for interpretation if required (R2(5) EPC; agreement of other parties is
not required. Guidelines EV, 5.
The minutes will be in French however (Rule 2(6) EPC)_
c) Divisional application must be filed in the language of proceedings of the parent
application = French (R4 EPC), if USCO are applicant If ITSA are the applicants, they
can file either in French, or in Italian, under Art 14(2) EPC, followed by a translation into
French within 1m of filing the divisional application (because = >3 months from filing
parent) (GL AIV 1.33), R4, R6 EPC)
d) Art 115 EPC doesn't prescribe any language requirements for 3rd palty observations.
Art 14(4) EPC allows documents to be filed within a time limit to be filed in a language
party is entitled to under Art 14(2) EPC, however this does not apply to 3rd party
observations because they do not have to be filed in a time limit
3rd party is not party to proceedings so RI (1) EPC does not apply.
Therefore 3rd party can file in any of the 3 official languages of Art 14(1) EPC, ie English,
French or Germam
