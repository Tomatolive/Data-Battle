Rule 86(4)EPC and G2/93, amended claims may not relate to unsearched
subject matter not combining with the originally claimed invention to form a
single general inventive concept
b) Yes because:
The patentee may file amended claims in opposition proceedings under
R57(1) EPC or R57a EPC_ However such amendments must not extend the
protection conferred (Art 123(3) EPC)_ According to G2/88, a change of claim
category mav not be a broadening amendment which would contravene Art
123(3) EPC Amendment of a product claim to a use claim is a limiting
amendment (because a product/substance claim includes all uses of that
product). So this amendment would be permitted according to Art123(3) and
G2/88. As the purpose of this use was originally disclosed, it seems that the
amendment would also comply with Art 123(2) EPC.
c) No because:
Although under R36(5) EPC the President of the EPO may permit documents
filed subsequent to filing the patent application to be transmitted by other
means than by post, electronic filing of such documents via EPO-line (which is
possible from 3/12/03 onwards) is only for use during grant proceedings
(OJ 2003, 609; Decn Pres OJ 2002, 543) and is not available for opposition and
appeal proceedings (OJ 2003, 609).
d) Yes because:
According to GI/03 and G2/03, an amendment by adding a disclaimer may
not be refused under Art 123(2) EPC just because there is no basis in the
application as filed. A disclaimer to give novelty over an Art 54(3) EPC
document is permitted, provided it doesn't also restore novelty or give
inventive step over an Art 54(2) EPC document, or remove more subject
matter than is required to give novelty.
So will be allowed with this proviso.
