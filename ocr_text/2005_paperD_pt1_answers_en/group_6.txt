Question 7
Fees to be paid in response to the R51 (4) Communication
- fee for grant, including fee for printing up to and including 35 pages (=€715)
- fee for printing 36th and each additional page = €10 each page
- pay claims fees for each claim from claim 11 onwards (R51(7) EPC)
No claims fees are due because only 10 claims.
- 1 extra page to pay for
Therefore total payable = €715 and 10 = €725
Actually paid €730 therefore overpaid bv €5.
According to Rfees 10c, a small excess payment is not repaid unless payer requests
and the EPO has determined <10 Euros to be a small amount (Decn President,
OJ EP02001, 521).
Therefore excess will not be repaid automaticallv_
Question 8
The decision under appeal = rejection of the opposition, therefore only the opponent O
was adversely affected by the decision, so only O can appeal (Art 107 EPC)_
Therefore client is a party as of right in the appeal proceedings (Ait 107EPC).
Filing of the Document Dl and the restricted claim set appear to have been carried out
in due time so should both be admssable per se.
However according to G8/93, if opponent as sole appellant withdraws his opposition
during appeal proceedings, this immediately and automatically terminates appeal,
irrespective of whether the patentee agrees or whether the patent meets the
requirements of the EPC
