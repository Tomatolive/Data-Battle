copy on request, the claim to priority will be lost (A91(3) EPC via A150(3)EPC)_ Although
this provision is intended to be used where non-supply of the priority document in the
International Phase is due to the applicant, rather than the situation here, it would seem
to apply here too because the International Phase has now terminated so the 1B will
have no further involvement
Therefore, to maintain a priority claim, the applicant should provide the EPO with a
certified copy obtained from the USPTO_ If the priority claim is actually not particularly
important because there is no relevant prior art between the filing and priority dates,
then the lack of a priority document may have no significance in substantive
examination.
When the EPO communicates with the applicant under RI 11(2) requesting the priority
document, a time limit for reply will be given. If the applicant doesn't manage to achieve
this, may be able to extend the time limit under R84 EPC and restitutio would be
possible (Art 122 EPC) (if for example, lack of response is due to difficulty obtaining a
copy from the USPTO)_
Question 5
In order to have the written opinion re-examined in the International Phase, a demand
for International Preliminary Examination (AN 31 (1) PCT) must be filed.
The time limit to file the demand = any time prior to the latest of
1) 3m from date of transmittal of search report and written opinion
= 9/1/05 (Sunday) extended to 10/1/05 (R80.5 PCT)
and
2) 22m from priority date = 8/3/05 (Tuesday)
(Rule 54bis_ I(a) PCT)
- Therefore demand must be filed by 8/3/05
- Should be filed with the EPO as competent PEA (Art 31.6(a), (b) PCT)
- Fees need to be paid:
- handling fee (R5T1 PCT) which is due within 1 month of date of submitting demand
or 22m from priority date, whichever is later (R57 _3a PCT); and
preliminary examination fee (R58.1a PCT) which is due in the same time limit as the
handling fee (R58.1b PCT).
