There can be no examination by the EPO of its own motion under Art 114 EPC as no
proceedings are now pending.
Therefore the client cannot restrict the patent before the EPO
However if Dl really is highly relevant, the client could, and should, seek to amend the
patent in post-grant proceedings before each national office of the designated
contracting states which he has validly entered, in order to ensure that his patent is
valid. The ability to do this and the procedure required will depend on national law.
If he doesn't amend, there is danger of revocation (grounds for revocation under
Art 138 EPC include the grounds of ArtlOO(a) EPC - Art 1 38(1 EPC).
Question g
According to Art 25 EPC, at the request of the competent national court trying a
revocation action, the EPO is obliged to give a technical opinion concerning the
European patent which is the subject of the patent, on payment of a fee (Rfees 2(20))_
The opinion, drawn up by the responsible examining division is similar to those given
during the examination process but does not expressly give an opinion as to whether the
patent is valid (Guidelines EXII, 2). The opinion will be concerned with technical aspects,
according to the specific request of the national court.
So EPO will give a technical opinion but not make a specific statement about validity.
Question 10
a) According to Art 14(3) EPC, French is the official language of proceedings for this
application, as the language of translation under Art 14(2) EPC
There is no provision in the EPC to change the language of proceedings.
Any amendment to the patent application filed during substantive examination must be
filed in French (RI(2) EPC)_
