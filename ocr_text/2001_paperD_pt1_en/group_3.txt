patent application. The examiner's opinion is that the subject-matter of claim I is not novel in the
light of an abstract Ofa scientific article, Both the abstract and the scientific article were published
before the priority date of the application.

reflect the article, which itself is not novelty-destroying.

A European patent application was filed on IS March 1987. The patent was granted in July 1990.
For the following years, the renewal fees were duly paid. After paying the fees in 1995, the patentee
allowed the patent to lapse in all designated contracting states by paying no further renewal fees.

Would it be possible under the EPC to inspect the file at the EPO? If so, until when?
What would be the position if a patent granted on a divisional application filed from this
application is still in force in one of the contracting states?
