An Italian applicant files two European patent applications, EPI, which claims the priority of Italian
application , and EP2, which claims the priority of Italian application IT2.
EPI is filed in Italian and is identical to ITI. An English translation is supplied to the EPO two
weeks later. EP2 is filed in English. It is a translation oflT2.
During the examination procedure, the English texts Of I and EP2 are found to contain
translation errors. Would it be possible to correct these errors?

Today. 28 March 2001. you are representing the patent proprietor in opposition proceedings before
the EPO.
With the summons to oral proceedings, which were requested by the sole opponent, the opposition
division gave its provisional opinion that the arguments put forward by the opponent were not
relevant and that the patent could be maintained as granted. The opponent announced that he
intends to attend the oral proceedings. You therefore likewise decided to attend.
At the start ofthe oral proceedings, the chairman informs you that the opponent has that very
morning sent a fax giving notice that he will not be coming to the proceedings. He further informs
you that the opposition division upholds its opinion that the patent can be maintained as granted.
You feel that your client has incurred unnecessary costs for the oral proceedings,
What can you do?
