Today, 28 March 2001, a US attorney phones you asking for urgent advice.
On 5 June 2000 he had filed a PCT application in English claiming priority of two US applications
filed on 10 June 1999 and on 15 September 1999. On 19 January 2001 the first priority was
withdrawn by the applicant. On 26 March 2001 he filed the demand for international preliminary
examination.
Would it still be possible to validly enter the regional phase before the EPO? If so, what steps have
to be undertaken and by when?
