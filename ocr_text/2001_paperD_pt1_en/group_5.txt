One of your clients phones you today, 28 March 2001. She tells you that she filed an EP application
designating all contracting states and that a competitor has been using her invention in some of
the designated states since February 2001. The application was filed in French in February 2000,
without claiming any priority rights; all fees have been duly paid.
She asks you to defend her rights. How would you proceed?
