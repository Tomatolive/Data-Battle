Opponent II has introduced a new document during appeal
proceedings under Art. 106 (3) since decision to maintain
patent unamended under Art. 102 (2) is in the form of an
interlocutory decision which is separately appealable — a
provided by recent notice Of EPO President concerning
opposition proceedings. Art. 114 (2) states that the EPO may
disregard facts or evidence which are not submitted in due
time. However. this facility is discret ionary and late—filed
documents which are highly relevant to the patentability Of
the invention in question may still be considered by the
Appeal Board dur ing proceedings. Thus it is not sufficient to
assume Appeal Board will not consider document .
If there is no doube that the combination of the new document
with the document disclosing the pre—characterising part of
claim 1 renders claim 1 Obvious then it is advisable to submit
the amended claim as soon as possible to ensure its
consideration by the Appeal Board, rather than waiting Eor the
oral proceedings However, if there is any doubt (usua11y
there is where two documents must be combined) then would
seill be wise to submit arguments in support of main claim
e. g . two documents would not have been combined by man ski Iled
in the art, and then a subsidiary set Of arguments and claims
which incorporate the restricted claim. This then provides a
certain fall —back position which must be considered before a
final decision under Art. 111 reached. If alternate claims
are not submitted urltil actual oral proceedings there is a
ri sk Chat Decision may be reached before opportunity to submit
amendrnents arises, although in accordance with Art. 113 all
parties Should have an Opportunity to present their corments
on any evidence on which a decision Is based.
