application and thus the patentee Will need to provide
evidence to show that there was, at that time i . e. January
1984. a confidentiality agreement between chem and Abel. Such
an agreement need not be in writing but could be a • tacit
understanding of secrecy• Thus attack Should be rebutted and
evidence in support of • abuse • Art. 55 (1) (a) provided.
Évidence may be provided in form of written statements taken
from, for example the sender and the recipi ent Of the letter
— taken in accordance with
forwarding the brochure to Abel
Rule 72 EPC.
One ground for opposition Art. 100 (a) is Iack Of inventive
step under Art. 56 and this has been alleged by Opponent II.
However, if the patentees assessment of the art rel {ed on is
borne out on closer inspection then this ground can be
effectively rebutted on the grounds that publications are not
related to the invention and to not render it obviousness.
Opponent II • s second argument is based on the requirement Of
Art. 84 for the claims to clearly and concisely def ine the
mat ter for which protection is sought. However, this argument
is not a valid ground of opposition under Art. 100 EPC and
cannot be rai sed in opposition proceedings. Accordingly this
ground can be simply dismissed on this basis .
In View Of the Iack Of good opposition arguments raised (one
weak and one inadmissible) i t is perhaps not so surprising
that Opponent II has now withdrawn (perhaps on Professional
advice) . Nevertheless, opposition proceedings will continue
with the patentee and Opponent I as parties, and since the
Opposition Division is entitled to examine the faces of its
own motion under Art. 114 (1) EPC, it will be necessary to
corment on Opponent II • s arguments to ensure that no further
consideration Of them is taken, either by the Opposition
Division or by the other opponent
In this way validity Of European patent Should be upheld.
The Opposition Division has stated that the opposition fi led
by Opponent I was inadmissible although no reasonS for
inadmissibility are stated in the exam question. Nevertheless
Opponent I • s appeal to the decision is apparent Iy based solely
on the grounds of opposition original Iy ti led and is not
di towards the reason for the Opposition Division ' s
decision concerning its admissibility. Since the Opposition
was deemed to be inadmissible any grounds raised therein
cannot be argued until the decision concerning adrnissibility
is overturned i . e. grounds are only considered the
opposition is admissible Art. 101 (1) EPC. No appeal against
admissibility has been rnade and thus other grounds of appeal
will not be considered — no opposition is deemed to have been
fi led by Opponent I. Thus lega I validity of patent is not at
ri sk from Opponent I. Weak arguments presented are not likely
to be reconsidered by Appeal Baard • of its own motion" under
Art. 116 EPC because al ready considered by Opposition
Division .
