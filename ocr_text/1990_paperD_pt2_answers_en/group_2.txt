effect that date of priori ty shall count ag date of fil ing for
purposes of Art. 54 (2) in accordance with Art. 89 EPC. Thus no
ef tect Of German document .
However earlier European application (withdrawn) was publ ished
under Art. 93 after this date but itself has a date of fil ing
earlier than that of the later European patent. Accordingly,
it comprises part of the state of the art in accordance with
Art. 54 (3) but on Iy in so far as the corrrnonly designated
Contracting States Art. 54 (4). The earlier application
designated on Iy AT, CH and FR, and thus cornprises state of art
Art. 54 (3) against European patent in NI', CH and FR but
DE, GB or NL.
The earlier application disclosed the temperature Of feature
(b) but different values for feature (a) . The earlier
appl ication does not therefore disclose the advantageous
combination of (a) and (b) but only an •equivalent• thereof.
Thus the novelty of claims 1 and 2 is not adversely affected
by the earlier European applicat ion. Furthermore, according to
Art. 56, second sentence, documents within the meaning of Art .
54 (3) cannot be considered when deciding whether there has
been an inventive step and thus the earlier European
application cannot be used as basis for an obviousness attack
against the later European patent .
NO other documents have been cited against the lacer European
patent and thus only the UK patent needs to be considered. The
patent was granted on 14 February 1990 and thus an opposition
can be fi led within 9 rnonths i . e. up to 14 November 1990
(Wednesday) Art. 99 (1) The subject matter Of claim 1 Iacks
novelty over the UK patent and this form.s a valid ground for
opposition under Art. 100 (a) — not patentable Wi thin terms Of
Art. 52—57, specifically Art. 54 (1) . Prospective licensee
cou Id file this opposition but better if patent proprietor
files it himself in order to ensure that fully valid patent is
maintained. Proprietor fil ing his own opposition has been
approved by Board of Appeal decision — Art. 99 (1) states that
"any person• may apply .
Thus file opposition and request deletion claim 1 but
maintenance of claim 2 as new and inventive over UK patent and
fully entitled to priori ty and thus novel over earlier
European patent application. All relevant art will then have
been fui Iy considered by EPO therefore licence can go ahead.
A1 though the brochure has not yet been published, the State Of
the art for the purposes of Art. 54 (1) is held to comprise
• everything made available to the public" Art. 54 A "tacit
understanding" is stated to exist between the patentee and
Abel Art. 55 (1) (a) provides that a disclosure will not be
considered if it occurred no earlier than six months preceding
the fil ing Of the application if it was due to or in
consequence Of "an evident abuse in relation to the
applicant• . This would be the Situation if it can be shown
that a breach of confidentiality had taken place. 19 January
1984 was within 6 months of the ti I ing date Of the European
