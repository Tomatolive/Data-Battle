An intemational patent application, designating EP, is filed within 12 months of, and claiming
the priority of, an identical first European patent application designating the same EPC
contracting states
(i) Is such priority claim valid? Justify your answer,
(ii) Assuming that the PCT application enters the European phase would it be possible to obtain
a granted patent on the EP application as well as on the international application?
A European patent has been granted to Company A on a product X. Company B has filed an
opposition to the grant at the EPO and submitted that its product Y. having the same composition
as product X, was sold without restriction three months before the priority date to company C.
The patentee A argues that no one was aware of the composition of product Y at the priority date
because its composition could only have been established by chemical analysis. Company C has
confirmed in a statement that it had made no such analysis at any time, because product Y had
turned out to be of no interest to them. The Opponent B does not dispute this statement by
Company C.
Does product Y belong to the state of the art with respect to the opposed patent? Please give
reasons.
