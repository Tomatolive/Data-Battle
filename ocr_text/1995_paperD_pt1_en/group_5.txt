Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia and Switzerland. He is not interested in individual national
filings and does not want to file PCT, but if possible only one European patent application.

limits are involved for each Of the countries mentioned above?
Your client has a European Patent application, EPI, (originally filed at the EPO on
8 January 1993 claiming priority from an earlier national application Of 8 January 1992) which
he has been prosecuting himself. Unfortunately, the last communication, dated 7 February 1995,
from the EPO on this case was a decision refusing the application under EPC Article l)
because your client had not agreed to incorporate an amendment in the claims proposed by the
Examiner in the previous official action to make the claims allowable and had responded to that
official action merely with further arguments against the Examiners assessment Of the pnor art
Your client now says that he would be happy to accept the amendment to the claims suggested
by the Examiner. He also tells you that he has paid no fees on the case over the last year
What actions, if any, should be taken, and by what date, to overcome the refusal Of EPI and to
keep the application alive with the minimum Of further expense and effort?
