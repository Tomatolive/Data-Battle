be possible to file a divisional application to the subject matter of EP2 (R25(1) EPC) and
retain EPI's filinq date (Art 76(1) EPC)_ Although EPI does not have any drawings, it
seems that the flap technology can be sufficiently described without the drawings, so
their absence will not be detrimental to validity.
Any subsequent disclosure (eg of the wing at the wedding) cannot effect validity of the
application. As no prior art was found in the search report, and EP2 (with a filing date
later than EPI) cannot be prior an against EPI , the resulting patent should be valid
(after all, EP2 granted).
[2=3] Therefore. in summary; to improve the situation (in Europe)
whoever owned EPI would have to correct the English text of EPI and rapidly file a
divisional to the subject matter of EP2_
- EP2 is not valid so no point wasting money on it.
- Client should instead buv EPI (much cheaper) and get access to both foamed core ad
flap technology in one go; need to hurry because grant of EPI = due in April and
divisional must be filed by then; also need to register transfer (Art 71).
If Mr Vinge sold EP2 to Mr Cervantes, an opposition against EP2 could be filed using
EPI as a ground under Art 100(a) EPC As Mr Cervantes has signed a binding
agreement to buy all rights that MOWE does not, then he is bound to do this.
[24] In the USA â€” flap technoloqv
There is no US patent application equivalent to EP2 (or EPI) which could protect the
flap technology in the USA, which is desirable in view of the tender for supply in
California.
EPI and EP2 both published more than a year ago so no protection can be derived
using the US grace period.
If entitlement of MOWE to the recycled foam technology of US equivalent of PCTI is
established, or a licence gained, it would be possible to use this technology in supplying
the Californian market, and protect it via this granted US patent (previously discussed in
paragraph 1.9) - would give partial protection to the wings that want to sell to Californian
company. As it has granted, it is too late to file a continuation-in-part to include the flaps
embodiment, even if MOWE owned the PCT and EP2.
Client should see what outcome of discussions with Mr Cervantes on 16/4/05 are and
then decide on a strategy for Californian tender due by 30/4/05.
