Memo to Client
Foamed Core technoloqv
[1=1] The process to make the wing and the wing itself are claimed in EPI. This was filed
without priority claim (deduced from publicn date = 18 months from filing date) on
29/4/02, in Danish which is 0K (AN 14(2) EPC). The translation was filed in time (<3
month from filing date, Art 14(2)) so appears to be validly filed.
Lack of drawings = irrelevant provided disclosure = sufficient without
No prior an found in search report and any disclosure after the filing date is irrelevant for
patentability so no reason to believe EPI is invalid for these claims.
No amendments made during exam, so no added matter.
Invention has an inventive step (lighter and cheaper).
Therefore claims to the foamed core technology are valid in EPI and Mr Vinge will get a
valid patent provided he fulfills the requirements under R51 (4) EPC for grant in April
2005.
[12] Use of recycled plastics material
The wing and process of EPI, but using recycled plastic core is claimed in PCTI, filed
without priority claim on 15/7/02 (publicn â€” Jan 04). PCTI represents a selection
invention over EPI effectively, with an inventive step based on the use of recycled
plastics, described by the client as obvious.
[1=3] EPI is prior art under Art 54(3) and (4) EPC against the European application
derived from PCTI so far the designated states overlap (R23a). It was not published
before PCTI was filed so is not prior art under Art 54(2) EPC, therefore is not citeable
for inventive step against PCTI.
[14] The disclosure of the content of EPI between MrV and MOWE on 15/5/02 took
place under a secrecy agreement, therefore this is not prior art against PCTI
[1=5] The presence of the wing incorporating all of the claimed invention of PCTI at the
wedding did not disclose the invention in an enabling manner, because the foam core is
