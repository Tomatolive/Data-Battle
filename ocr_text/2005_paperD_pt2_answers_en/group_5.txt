3 Dimples and knobs
[3=1] Dimples - EP3
Client filed patent application on the day of the wedding, when the prototype was
displayed. This appears to be the first public disclosure of the dimples. Whether or not
the disclosure was enabling for the invention (that it is surprisingly noise reducing) is
irrelevant as the state of the art under Art 54(2) EPC only comprises disclosures made
before the date of filing. So showing the wing at the wedding does not constitute prior
art (NE fax filing is sufficient to accord a filing date under Art 80 EPC; the EPO does not
have to be open to receive the fax â€” the filing date is accorded provided all of the
application is received before midnight).
so EP3 has a filing date of 4/7/02.
No prior an was found in the search so EP3 is novel.
The surprising effect gives inventive step. Therefore EP3 is valid.
[32] Dimples - EP4
Provided all of application was faxed through to the EPO before midnight on 4/7/02, EP4
will share the same filing date as EP3_ In this situation EP3 and EP4 are not prior art
against each other and both would go to grant (Denmark and Germany are in the same
time zone). There is no precedent for taking into consideration the actual time that the
EPO received the application when two applications are received on the same day, so
time difference of faxes = irrelevant
However Mr Cervantes stole the dimples invention after the discussion at the wedding.
The discussion took place after EP3 was filed and so cannot affect the validity of that
application. MOWE is entitled to this invention and could start entitlement proceedings
(in Denmark) for ownership of EP4, simultaneously requesting suspension of
proceedings. Once ownership was obtained, either EP3 or EP4 could be allowed to
lapse in order to prevent double patenting; alternatively MOWE could request refusal of
EP4 directly (Art 61 (l)(c) EPC) (for at least the dimples technology).
This should be raised in discussion with Mr Cervantes on 16/4/05.
