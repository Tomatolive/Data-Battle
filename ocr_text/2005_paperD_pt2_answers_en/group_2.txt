not visible (unless the wing is broken) (GI /92, T206/83, T26/85)_ Therefore this
exhibition is not prior art against PCTI.
Mr Vinge apparently probably disclosed the details of the foam technology and the
recycled plastics (Mr Vinge knew the details of the wing on display at the wedding, ie
having recycled plastics in it) to Mr Cervantes at the wedding.
It is arguable that a discussion at a private gathering, albeit of a substantial number of
people, including competitors, should be taken to be under conditions of confidentiality.
However, as it seems unlikely that MrV could, or would, be able to testify as to the exact
content of the disclosure, it would be difficult to use this as prior art against PCTI , as
proof of oral disclosure is required in detail.
Therefore it seems that there is no prior art which could be raised to help challenge the
novelty and/or inventive step of PCTI and it appears PCTI is therefore valid unless
client has any evidence to back up opinion that it is obvious (could file as 3rd party
observations, Art 115 EPC)_
[ld] However two factors need to be considered:
1) with EPI and PCTI both valid, it would seem likely that Mr Cervantes would need a
licence under EPI in order to commercialise PCTI. He apparently is already selling
widely so need to check the exact words of the two claims to see if he owes a licence
fee under EPI. In this situation, EPI might be well worth buying from Mr Vinge as might
be able to get a cross-licence to sell the recycled plastics version as claimed in PCTI
[LÃŸ] 2) It is quite likely that Mr Cervantes did in fact steal the information told to him by
Mr Vinge at the party and therefore MOWE is actually entitled to PCTI and derived
applications. Therefore wouldn't want to challenge validity. Should instead consider
arguments in favour of inventive step of PCTI
In order to improve situation, I would suggest starting entitlement proceedings (in
Denmark) and request that the EPO suspends examination proceedings for the Euro-
PCTI application (RI 3 EPC) (it is too late to file own patent application under
Art 55 EPC as PCTI published >12 months ago and the Art 55 time limit = 6 months).
