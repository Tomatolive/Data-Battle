[3=3] Knobs - EP4
MOWE did not disclose knobs to Mr Cervantes and this aspect is not present in EP3_
However the knobs are merely a commonly known equivalent of the dimples. The
inventive concept of EP4 resides in the distribution and this is claimed in EP3
So once entitlement to the dimples aspects of EP4 by MOWE is established, the
remaining knobs subject matter of EP4 will lack any inventive step (Art 56 EPC) and are
therefore not patentable on their own.
[3=4] Summary
Through entitlement proceedings MOWE should get exclusive ownership of a valid
patent to the dimples. DQWE will probably not get a patent to the knobs alone but will be
free to sell them because they will not be within the scope of EP3. However MOWE will
be equally at liberty to sell them.
To improve situation, client should initiate entitlement proceedings for EP4 dimples
invention prior to discussion with Mr Cervantes.
4. The actions recommended are:
1) buy EPI and file divisional to EP2 subject matter after text correction. This doesn't
involve DQWE_ Need to hurry — delay grant?
2) If PCT-I falls within the scope of EPI consider infringement action against DQWE for
past sales in Europe of recycled foam. This could not be anonymous.
3) If DQWE buy EP2, file an opposition against EP2 by 2/5/05 using EPI as grounds
under Art 100(a) EPC_ The opposition could be filed in the name of a 3rd party ('straw
man", G3/97 and G4/97) and this would not be an abuse of process. So could keep
involvement in this aspect a secret, although citation of EPI might make it obvious.
4) File 3rd palty observations against Euro-PCTI (Art 115 EPC) showing it is obvious
however need evidence and wouldn't do if follow 5) below (would be anonymous
though)
5) start entitlement proceedings for Euro-PCTI and US equivalent action. This can't be
anonymous as whole point is to prove entitlement as the true inventor. This does give
the best chance of protecting commercialisation of the (now not secret) recycled plastics
foam.
6) start entitlement proceedings for EP4 — similarly can't be anonymous.
