We filed a British patent application 07 99999.9 (GBI) in which we described our trials
and all of the above mentioned results in full. No claims were included with this filing,
which was given a date of filing of 6th January 2007.
Iris handled our patent filings, and she filed a European patent application 07 777777
(EPI) claiming priority of GBI_ EPI has a date of filing of 20th December 2007 and was
filed with a single claim to compositions comprising known slug and snail attractants, an
adhesive, and a copper compound selected from either escargines, slugbanite or both.
GBI was subsequently abandoned without publication.
After filing EPI Iris realised that she had not claimed the method of coating plant pots or
the coated plant pots themselves and so filed two further applications 08 00001 1 (EP2)
and 08 000022 (EP3) which both have a date of filing of 7th January 2008
EP2 was filed with a single clam to a method of coating at least a part of the
surface of plant pots with compositions comprising compounds containing copper
selected from either escargines, slugbanite or both.
EP3 was filed with two claims, an independent claim claiming plant pots coated at
least in part with compositions comprising compounds containing copper
selected from either escargines, slugbanite or both, and a dependent claim
claiming the specific location of the coating as being a band between one quarter
to three quarters the height of the plant pot
Iris found no difficulty with preparing the claims in EPI , EP2 and EP3 since she was
able to use paragraphs from the description of GBI
The description for each application was identical to that of GBI and the filing, search,
all designation and extension fees and the examination fees were paid on all three
applications. EP2 and EP3 also claim priority of GBI
