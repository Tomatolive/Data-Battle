You receive today, 3rd March 2009 a fax from Angelica Gigas, owner of Silybum
Horticultural Limited, a British supplier of gardening products.
"My firm is in need of urgent advice and wishes to appoint you as our patent attorney. I
would like to meet you next week to discuss my firm's patent portfolio but in the
meantime ask you to consider the following situation.
Damage to plants by snails, and their shell free allies, slugs, is a significant problem and
is particularly annoying to the amateur gardener. For many years it has been known that
slugs and snails do not like contact with copper metal, and strips of copper are
conventionally placed around plants or fixed to the rim of plant pots so as to prevent
slugs and snails from crossing the strips.
Iris Stylosa, our technical director, and I realised that a similar effect to use of copper
metal might be achieved by applying long lasting compounds containing copper to the
surface of a plant pot. In trials we found that escargines [a well known class of organo-
copper compounds (organic compounds containing copper)], and slugbanite [a known
inorganic copper mineral] do not merely deter slugs and snails but kill them. I suggested
the use of escargines, and Iris suggested the use of slugbanite, but to both our surprise
the combination of escargines and slugbanite was found to provide a stronger effect
than either alone, killing slugs and snails almost instantly.
We also found that the best position for applying these materials to the plant pot is not
the rim, but in one or more bands, which may be only millimetres wide, but situated
above the base of the plant pot at between about one quarter to three quarters the
height of the plant pot We found that mixing escargines and/or slugbanite with known
slug and snail attractants (e.g. beer) and an adhesive provided a composition that was
suitable for coating plant pots
