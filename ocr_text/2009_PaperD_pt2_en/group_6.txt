Big Farma have asked me to meet them and I am going to see them today as they may
be a big opportunity to market our invention, however I am worried in case they want to
use PCT-BF to attack us. I will use this meeting to find out what Big Farma want, but for
discussion on my return could you please provide a memorandum:
2
3
4.
5.
Advising as to the status of our European patents and European patent
applications (as I will be travelling until the end of July, please indicate what we
need to do in the next five months to keep them in good order)
Advising as to patentability and any problems you see with our European patents
and European patent applications
Advising as to whether and how they can be improved
Advising as to whether we can recover the PCT application that Iris Stylosa failed
to file covering all of the subject matter of GB2
Advising as to what our strategy should be concerning Big Farma [we need to
know what to do if they are aggressive, or if they want to co-operate]
A confirmation copy of this fax together with copies of GBI and GB2 was sent to you
with delivery guarantee for this afternoon.
Please take this fax as being authority to take any action that you deem fit to preserve
our position pending our meeting next week. Please note that any enquiries you have,
or further documents that you need, will have to wait until our meeting, as our offices are
closed until the end of next week, and I will not be contactable for the next three days
