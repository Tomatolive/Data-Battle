I instructed Iris to protect this invention in Europe, including Albania, and as US
protection was wanted an international patent application was prepared with the same
description as GB2, naming Silybum Horticultural Limited as applicant for all countries
other than the United States, and naming Iris and me as applicants for the United States
and inventors for all countries. This was signed and dated 24th December 2008, and
placed in an envelope for posting to the EPO, we independently ordered payment of the
fees to an EPO account and this was credited to the account in mid-January 2009.
However, on checking our post room this week we found that the envelope with the
application had fallen behind a desk and was never mailed. Our secretary, Daphne
Burkwood, is very upset about this as she has been with us since we founded the firm
and is extremely reliable and we have never had such an incident before. I will give you
the envelope and a copy of the application documents when we meet.
This is very imponant since last week I was contacted by Big Farma, a US agrochemical
company having their European manufacturing facilities in Albania Their letter reports
that they have an international patent application PCT/US2006/99999 (PCT-BF)
protecting escargines_ I have checked and PCT-BF was filed 15th December 2006
without a claim to priority and published in August 2008. There appears to be no search
report yet This application describes and claims compositions containing organo-copper
compounds and an adhesive for use as slug and snail killers and discloses escargines in
one of the examples. PCT-BF also discloses methods of coating plant pots and coated
plant pots, but only discloses coating the whole plant pot or the rim of plant pots. PCT
BF does not disclose using snail and slug attractants in the compositions.
