No relevant documents were found in any of the search reports and EPI and EP3 were
granted ISt March 2009 without any amendment. A communication under Rule 71 (3)
EPC issued on EP2 last week, accepting the application as filed.
In late 2007 we discovered a potential problem in that some of the coated plant pots we
were testing failed to kill slugs and snails We quickly found that the problem was in the
slugbanite we were using. Apparently, minerals can vary in composition and it is well
known that slugbanite comes in four forms, A,B,C, and D. We found that slugbanite-A
and slugbanite-B can each kill slugs and snails, but slugbanite-C and slugbanite-D do
not. The examples given in GBI referred to slugbanite from the Hosta la Vista mine
which was named as the source of the slugbanite_ The Hosta la Vista mine produces
only slugbanite-A, which is conventionally used for glazing toilet bowls, however we did
not mention slugbanite-A by name. At this time we also discovered a particularly
effective method of preparing finely divided slugbanite for use in the slug and snail killing
compositions.
As we did not want to confuse the prosecution of EPI, EP2 and EP3, we did not mention
the lack of effect of slugbanite-C and slugbanite-D in those applications, but instead we
filed British patent application number 08 01234.6 (GB2) which described slug and snail
killing compositions similar to those described in GBI, and comprising slugbanite-B
alone or in combination with escargines. A similar description was used to GBI , but
reference to the slugbanite from the Hosta la Vista mine was replaced by reference to
slugbanite-B, and the method of preparing slugbanite for use in the compositions was
described. No claims or drawings were filed with this application, which was accorded a
date of filing of 3rd January 2008
GBI, GB2, EPI, EP2, and EP3 were all filed in the name of Silybum Holticultural
Limited.
