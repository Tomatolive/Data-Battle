Part II
The purpose of this part of the examination is to ascertain whether the candidate can
give clear reasoned advice on the basis of the facts presented and whether the candi-
date has sufficient knowledge that the clear advice is not dangerous. Candidates who are
able to organise the information presented and to give firm proposals for action tend to
get good marks. Those who give an unorganised recitation Of facts they know (whether
relevant or not), and whose answers consist mostly Of questions, are not so successful.
Production Of a time line appears to be Of assistance, but on its own is no substitute for
a reasoned answer.
Question 1: Will it be possible to get a valid patent in Europe for the subject
matter of FORM-EU2?
This question was generally well answered by those candidates who realised that
SAD-FORM and SAD-FORM/2 had different priority dates. Those candidates who took
time to clearly analyse what embodiments of SAD-FORM were entitled to what priority
date generally gained full or near-full marks.
Question 2: What actions would you take to secure patent protection?
In their enthusiasm to protect SAD-FORM/2 and the new Oil invention, surprisingly many
candidates did not appreciate that to obtain protection for SAD-FORM it Was essential to
maintain FORM-EU2.
Most candidates did not appreciate that although a journal article may bear a date, this is
not necessarily the date of publication, which may be earlier or later. Some candidates
realised that if the actual publication date of the Blowit article was later than 1 st April 1999
there may still have been time to file a US application Within the grace period and so gain
protection for SAD-FORM.
Question 3: Will it be possible to get protection for the isolation process and
SAD-PROT?
This question was often well answered but a significant number Of candidates did not
analyse what claims were sustainable, and/or did not analyse what amended claims
could be filed under Rule 86. Some candidates did not appear to know the date they
were sitting the examination and so missed points for realising that a due date had
passed.
Question 4: What would be the consequences Of American Air Force filing patent
applications?
Many candidates realised that an American Air Force application could not have been
filed before AAF did their work in 1999.
Some candidates did not clearly address who required a licence and for what. Some
suggested cross-licensing without explaining what was licensed.
