Q2: Regarding the measures Which have to be taken in order to obtain the best
possible patent protection in Europe, US, Japan and as many countries as
possible for these inventions:
The priority year for SAD-FORM has lapsed (priority date: 24/7/98), so we cannot file
any follow-up application for SAD-FORM validly claiming the priority from FORM-UKI.
For Europe, we have to ensure that the application FORM-EU2 stays alive. Hence, the
examination fee and the designation fees for FORM-EIJ2 should be paid. The Search
Report for FORM-EU2 has already been published (around 26/01/2000), therefore the
designation fees will become due (earliest 26/7/2000). As we want broad protection,
we should pay for all states, which can be done for the cost of seven.
As Gobbleup Wishes to Obtain patent protection in as many countries as possible,
a PCT application should be filed,
designating all states and
claiming priority Of FORM•EU2.
As the subject-matter conceming SAD-FORW2 has been disclosed for the first tirne
in FORM-EU2, this added matter can still be claimed for all states.
If Gobbleup applies for Preliminary International Examination, no translations or national
fees need to be paid within the next 30 months, so Gobbleup can pay later, when the
commercial value Of SAD-FORW2 can be better assessed.
The content of the PCT application should contain not only everything from FORM-EU2,
but, additionally, the mixture with oil, as this form seems to be the most interesting
commercially. Alternatively, this mixture with Oil could also be claimed in a separate
application.
The only document of the Search Report is the article by Prof. Blowit. Neither,
SAD-FORMÆ nor the mixture with Oil has been disclosed in this article, and both Of these
are therefore novel. We will have to show that they are also inventive, which should not
be difficult.
SAD-FORW2 because of the reasons given above (see question 1) and the mixture with
oil should be patentable because of the unexpected effects of enhanced stability and
effectiveness.
In order to validly claim priority, Sadly Resources and Gobbleup should be the applicants,
except for the US, where the inventors Dr Fairy and Prof. Blowit will be the applicants.
Though the priority year for SAD-FORM is over, there might still be a possibility to get
a valid patent for SAD-FORM in the US because Of the grace period Of one year. The
article of Prof. Blowit is dated 1/4/99. Check with the publishers the actual date of
publication of the article. If it has been published later than 1/4/99, the grace period of
one year may not have lapsed yet. For that reason and also to get the earliest priority
date for the new invention, the PCT application, Claiming also the subject-matter Of
SAD-FORM, should be filed immediately!
