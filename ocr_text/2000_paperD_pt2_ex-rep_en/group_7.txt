(a) If Gobbleup wants to get patent rights for the new, high yield process and
assuming that Gobbleup is willing to pay Fat-Cat one million euros:
Gobbleup should inform Fat-Cat that they are willing to pay, provided Fat-Cat files a
European application in its name, claiming priority of FAT-EU (this can only be done until
7/4/00, thus in two days). This time all the fees should be paid. Later this new European
application can be assigned to Gobbleup.
Gobbleup should refile ENZ-EU on or before 12/4/2000 claiming priority of the application
filed 12/4/1999, with an amplified description to ensure sufficient disclosure (referring to
Genie-Genie patent and the newspaper article). File in the name Of Sadly-Resources to
claim priority validly.
It would, however, be better to combine the subject matter Of FAT-EU and ENZ-EU and
claim both priorities in a single application with joint applicants filed on or before 7/4/2000
— however, this might not be possible due to the limited time available to get the agree-
ment of Fat-Cat.
If this •joint' application is possible, a divisional application might be necessary, as the
high yield process and the use of the product as slimming aid may lack unity, the only
common technical feature, the product SAD-ENZ being known.
(b) If Gobbleup is not willing to pay Fat-Cat any money:
NO fees have been paid for FAT-EU. This means, if no further application Clah-ning the
priority of FAT-EU is filed, the application FAT-EU will have no outstanding rights after
the lapse of the convention deadline. Hence, if Gobbleup is not interested in patent rights
for the new, high yield process, it can let the priority period Of FAT-EU pass without any
action.
The newspaper article describing the new process being public knowledge, and if not
patented by third parties, Gobbleup may use it anyway (but cannot prevent others from
using it too).
