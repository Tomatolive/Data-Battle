So Gobbleup should be able to get patent protection for the process for purifying proteins
from brewers yeast and for SAD-Prot per se, but, most likely, not for the isolation
process in general.
Concerning the designated states:
The Article 79(2) time limit (six months after publication Of the application, the new
regulation applies) and the 2 months extension period have both expired, hence it is too
late to add designations to PROT-EUI.
Normally, in a divisional application no other countries can be designated beyond those
already designated in the parent application. But, as G4/98 is still pending, it could be
tried and we will file a divisional application with all countries designated, referring to
G4/98.
The applicant of the divisional application must be the same as for the parent application,
thus Sadly-Resources.
Conclusion: We will try, but, most probably, Gobbleup will only get patent-protection in
the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
04: Regarding the implications Of possible patent applications Of the
US Air Force:
The research work of the American Air Force was carried out in 1999, so we can assume
that, if any filing was done, then it was done at the earliest in 1999. This would be later
than the priority date Of PROT-EUI (14/1/97). so a possible patent application from the
USAF would not constitute prior art with respect to PROT-EUI.
However, PROT-EUI would be prior art against any application from the US Air Force
and therefore the IJS Air Force cannot get protection for SAD-PROT itself. The US Air
Force could, however, get protection for SAD-PROT as a medicament for reducing the
effects Of jetlag or for making medicaments reducing the effects Of jetlag, as this activity
Of SAD-PROT has not been disclosed in PROT-EUI. A claim directed to a method Of
treatment of the symptoms of jetlag would not be allowable in Europe.
If the US Air Force published the article before filing a patent application, USAF may
get protection in the US only, but not protection in Europe. This should be checked.
In conclusion, USAF would require a license under PROT-EUI (or its divisional) to
manufacture, sell or use SAD-PROT for any purpose in I-JK, France or Germany, as
Gobbleup has the earlier patent rights in these countries.
On the Other hand, if the US Air Force applies for a patent in Europe, Gobbleup would
require a license from USAF to produce, sell or use (or license) SAD-PROT as a
medicament or for producing medicaments reducing the effects of jetlag.
Cross-licensing is a possible way out Of this impasse.
