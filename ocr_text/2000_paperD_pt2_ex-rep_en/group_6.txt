05: Regarding the measures to be taken with respect to SAD-ENZ:
First we should check the status Of the two applications conceming SAD-ENZ, namely
ENZ-EU and FAT-EU.
ENZ-EU was filed by Sadly-Resources on 12/4/99, so the convention deadline expires
12/4/00. ENZ-EU describes the structure of the enzyme SAD-ENZ and its activity, but
does not contain any information on how to prepare SAD-ENZ It is therefore doubtful,
whether the disclosure is sufficient.
The Gene-Genie application, which has been filed in 1996, has been published before
the filing date Of ENZ-EU (18 months after filing) and, therefore, constitutes prior art
against ENZ-EU. This application describes not only the structure Of SAD-ENZ, but also
a way of preparing the enzyme. The disclosure Of the Gene-Genie application and the
newspaper report being public knowledge at the filing date of ENZ-EU, this disclosure
Of how to prepare SAD-ENZ may be used to show that the disclosure Of ENZ-EU was
sufficient on the day Of filing.
As the Gene-Genie application discloses the structure also of SADâ€¢ENZ, the structure
of SAD-ENZ is no longer patentable. However, the activity of SAD-ENZ has not been
disclosed in the Gene-Genie application, so that this activity is not prejudiced by this
document.
Also the newspaper report, which was published on 9/4/99, is prior art against ENZ-EU.
The newspaper report describes the Structure and a method Of preparing SAD-ENZ, but
does not mention its activity. Therefore, also the newspaper repott prejudices novelty and
inventive step Of the structure Of SAD-ENZ, but does not prejudice the patentability Of the
activity of SAD-ENZ.
The activity Of SAD-ENZ could therefore be validly claimed in ENZ-EU.
FAT-EU was filed by Fat-Cat on 7/4/99, so that the priority year will end on 7/4/00 (in two
days'). FAT-EU describes the structure Of SAD-ENZ and a new, high yield process for its
preparation. It does not mention the activity of SAD-ENZ
The Genie-Genie application is also prior art against FAT-EU and, therefore, prejudices
novelty and inventive step of the structure of SAD-ENZ. It does not anticipate the high.
yield process for the preparation of the enzyme, as this process was not disclosed in the
Gene-Genie application.
The newspaper report of 9/4/99 is published after the filing date Of FAT-EU and thus
does not constitute prior art.
FAT-EU, if maintained, should give valid patent protection for the new, high yield process
of preparing SAD-ENZ.
so, Gobbleup will not get patent protection in Europe for the enzyme SAD-ENZ per se.
But, by keeping ENZ-EU alive, it should get valid patent protection for the activity of
SAD-ENZ.
