For non-PCT countries national applications should be filed.
There could also be filed a second PCT application later on, claiming priority Of the
first PCT-application, so as to prolong the patent term for the Oil mixture feature.
03: Regarding the possible patent protection for the isolation process in general
and for SAD-PROT in all EP-countries:
First Of all, we have to check Whether we can keep the application PROT-EUI alive:
The communication Of the examining division dated 4/9/99 is deemed to have been
received the 14/9/99. The four months time limit and the two months prolongation are
aggregate time limits, therefore the time limit for the response expired 14/3/2000. NO
response was sent by this date, and, as a result, the application is deemed to be
withdrawn under Article 96(3) EPC. As the time limit for answering the Communication
is set by the Examining Division, further processing under Article 121 EPC is possible.
Gobbleup should therefore request further processing, pay the fee, file a response to
the official communication and also include a claim to SAD-PROT and to the process Of
purifying proteins from brewer's yeast. Gobbleup can do this immediately, we do not have
to wait for the official letter that the application is deemed to be withdrawn.
As a further point, in order to keep the application alive, we should check Whether the
fourth year renewal fee has been paid (due end January 2000) and if not, pay it With
surcharge.
Thus, the formal requirements to keep the application alive, should be fulfilled. As to
the subject-matter Gobbleup would like to get patented, the following points should be
discussed at the meeting:
Though the isolation process per se does not seem patentable in the light Of the
documents cited in the Search Report, the process for purifying proteins from brewer's
yeast might be patentable. If such claims were included they would also give protection
for the products directly obtained by the claimed process (Art. 64(2) EPC), hence also
for SAD-PROT.
However, a claim directed directly to SAD-PROT would be commercially more interest-
ing. SAD-PROT can be used as a fermentation promoter and should, therefore, be
patentable as a product per se.
SAD-PROT was disclosed in PROT-EUI, therefore a claim to SAD-PROT can be
included under Art. 123(2) EPC. As the original claims were only directed to the isolation
process in general, most probably, SAD-PROT has not been searched. Hence, the
introduction of a claim directed to SAD-PROT may not be allowable under Rule 86(4)
EPC (as it concerns unsearched subject-matter which does not form a single inventive
concept with the originally claimed invention). In this case a divisional application should
be filed while the parent application PROT-EUI is still pending. The divisional application
could be continued, even if the parent application is abandoned.
