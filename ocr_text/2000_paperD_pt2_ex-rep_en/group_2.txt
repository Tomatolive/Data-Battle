Question 5: What actions must be taken in the next two years concerning
SAD-ENZ?
Again, those candidates who analysed what inventions were entitled to what priority
dates, and what documents were available as prior art against each invention, were
able to get good marts.
Most candidates did not comment on the apparent insufficient disclosure of ENZ-EU.
Model Answer on Paper D, Part II
Memorandum for the meeting with the General Director Of Gobbleup:
QI: Regarding the first question, whether it will be possible to obtain patent
protection in Europe for subject-matter Of FORM-EU2:
The application FORM-UKI , describing SAD-FORM, was filed on 24/7/98.
The application FORM-EU2, claiming the priority of SAD-FORM, was filed on 26/7/99.
As 24/7/99 was a Saturday, according to Rule 85 EPC, FORM-EU2 could still be filed
until the following Monday (26/07/99), thus it was filed within the time limit for validly
claiming priority.
However, the priority claim covers only those parts which have already been disclosed
in FORM-UKI. SAD-FORW2, which has not been disclosed in FORM-UKI, thus has
the priority date of 26/7/99.
Under the terms Of his agreement with Sadly-Resources Professor Blowit was entitled to
publish the article on 1/4/99, as this article only contains the subject-matter Of FORM-UKI ,
which had been filed prior to the disclosure. There is surely no breech of confidentiality.
This article is not considered as prior art for the subject-matter Of FORM-UKI
(SAD-FORM), as it is published after its (valid) priority date, 24/7/98. However, Professor
Blowifs article is prior art for SAD-FORW2, which can only claim a priority date of 26/7/99.
In order to get a valid patent in Europe for the subject-matter of FORM-EIJ2, we have to
show that SAD-FORW2 is new and inventive over the article of Prof. Blowit. This should
be possible, as SAD-FORW2 is commercially important and therefore it is likely that it has
effects
Conclusion: The article of Prof. Blowit should not prevent us from getting a valid patent
in Europe for the subject-matter of FORM-EU2 (ie SAD-FORM and SAD-FORW2).
