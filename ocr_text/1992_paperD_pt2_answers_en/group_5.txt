Due dates for certain procedures before the international and
national Offices are taken to run from the priority date
(Art. 2 (xi) PCT) .
The Japanese applicants clearly elected Chapter II to delay the
procedure (under Art. 39 (1) (a) and Art. 31 (1) PCT) within the 19
and would therefore enter the regional phase
month time limit set —
at the EPO 31 months after the priori ty date (PCT Art. 39 (1) (a)
states 30 months, but PCT Art. 39 (1) (b) says that any elected State
may fix a later time limit — and R. 104b (1) EPC states 31 months
for such applications) .
Entry into the regional phase involved:
i) Payment Of tees as in R. 104b(1) (d) and
i i) fil ing Of a translation Of the application under R. 104b(1) (a)
and Art. 158 (2) .
It appears that the Japanese applicant paid the necessary
fees, but forgot to file the translation required.
The resuit of this omission is that the application would be deemed
withdrawn. Clearly this is the situation - as evidenced by the
corrununication Of the EPO.
Because the time limit for fil ing the translation is set by the
EPC, the JapaneSe applicants can only restore the application by
fil ing a request for restitution under Art. 122 (as previously
discussed) .
The late fil ing Of the translation cannot be excused — there are no
provisions for Such in the EPC - but, if the application for
restitution is fi led and is successful, the translation would be
deemed to be f iled on time.
The exam fee was due irrunediately on entry into the regional phase —
under R. 104b(1) (d) . However, the EPO should have sent a
notification under R. 85b setting a one month period Of grace for
fi ling the exam request.
Presumably the applicants overran this deadline as well. However,
unlike under the EPC, the period for requesting examination of a
regional PCT is suscept i ble to restitution [Board Of Appeal — —
decision) , and Chus, with a successful ion application, the
applicant could still have a valid application.
The fact that the applicant fil ed a written request explaining the
delay - and cornpleted the missing — may be considered to be an
application for restitution, Iacking on Iy the fee. The EPO may
inform the appli cant that a fee should be paid if the application
is to be Successful.
it appears that it
As this was fi led *within the last few days• ,
would be within the period for restitution as defined in Art. 122 .
provisional protection for the Japanese application would on Iy
start from when the application i s published in an EPO language.
You could only be sued tor infringement, therefore, from that date.
