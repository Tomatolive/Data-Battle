Dear Mr Patent Attorney,
We are a major manufacturer of tennis rackets focused exclusively on the European
market. Our facilities are located in Copenhagen, Denmark, where we also have our
own patent department taking care of all our patent matters.
On 01_02.2006 we filed an application for a Danish utility model DK-U describing and
claiming a newly developed tennis racket RI comprising titanium fibres in the frame.
This choice of material results in tennis racket RI being particularly light and stiff DK-U
was published in April 2006. However, during extensive tests it turned out that, due to
the inclusion of titanium fibres, tennis racket RI showed annoyingly high vibrations
when hitting a ball. Since no available racket dampers were suitable for RI , our
engineers solved this problem by developing a racket damper Dl , which suppresses
vibrations and is made of known materials but characterized by a specific shape
Although the technology of Dl offers significant advantages in particular for tennis
rackets, it can be used for all kinds of sports rackets, for example badminton or squash
rackets. We filed a Danish patent application DKI on 2112.2006 claiming the priority of
DK-U. DKI describes and claims tennis racket RI and racket damper Dl separately as
well as tennis racket RI combined with racket damper Dl _ With respect to tennis racket
RI the description and claims of DKI are identical to DK-LJ.
