Besides the issues mentioned above, our R&D department was also working on a new
moisture absorbent sports racket grip G. Since we planned to equip all our rackets with
grip G we filed a further Danish patent application DK2 on 29.12.2006, which likewise
claims the priority of DK-U. DK2 describes and claims tennis racket RI and grip G
separately as well as tennis racket RI combined with grip G. With respect to tennis
racket RI the description and claims of DK2 are identical to DK-U
In August 2007 DKI and DK2 were published with their respective search reports,
which did not cite any relevant prior art At the same time we started sales of our tennis
racket RI combined with racket damper Dl and grip G.
On 14.112007 we filed an English translation of DK2 as European patent application
EP2 clanmng priority of DK2.
In order to fufther improve our market position in Europe we also filed an English
translation of DKI as European patent application EPI on 15.12.2007 claiming priority
of DKI
Before filing EPI and EP2 we had carried out a prior art search, which revealed FR-
BEP and PCT-DS as the only potentially relevant prior art documents.
FR-BEP is a French patent application filed on 03.002005 by a small engineering
company "Bureau d'Ã©tudes de Paris" (BEP)_ FR-BEP does not claim any priority and
was published on 05.032007. It describes and claims a racket damper D2, which is
clearly different from and operates on a different principle to racket damper Dl , but is
apparently as effective.
