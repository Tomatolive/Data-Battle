PCT-DS is a PCT-application filed by the Indian company DelhiSport Ltd. (DS), a spons
equipment manufacturer which has so far been active in Asia only. PCT-DS has a filing
date of 08.122006 and designates all PCT contracting states. It claims the priority of an
Indian patent application IN-DS filed on 10.12.2005. IN-DS was filed by DS and has the
same contents as PCT-DS_ The claims of PCT-DS are directed to a sports racket R in
general, which comprises titanium fibres in the frame. Its description discloses the
specific examples of a badminton racket, a squash racket and a tennis racket, the
tennis racket being identical to our tennis racket RI. PCT-DS was published on
1506.2007 in English.
Neither PCT-DS nor FR-BEP, which were both searched at the EPO, has any relevant
prior art cited in their respective search reports.
In the evening of 21 _ 122007 our patent department had their traditional candle light
party in their office celebrating the end of a successful year 200T Nobody can explain
why, but suddenly there was smoke in the file store and a few minutes later the office
was on fire. Luckily nobody was seriously injured but the office of the patent department
was completely destroyed. Unfortunately, also the backup files stored in a fire proof
safe in the cellar were destroyed by water flooding. Consequently, the departments
regular review meeting scheduled for 28122007, during which the status and
completeness of all files would normally have been checked and further necessary
actions discussed and prepared, had to be cancelled.
