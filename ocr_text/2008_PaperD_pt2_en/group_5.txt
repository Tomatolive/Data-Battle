While we were still busy repairing the damage caused by the fire, we were surprised by
a press release issued by DS on 05.022008, in which DS announced plans to enter the
European market According to their press release, they plan to offer for sale three
types of tennis rackets in Europe:
Tennis racket RI combined with racket damper Dl ,
tennis racket RI combined with racket damper D2 and
tennis racket RI combined with grip G.
They will also offer for sale squash and badminton rackets using the same technology.
The DS press release explains in detail the features of the sports rackets, in particular
those of the above mentioned types of tennis rackets. A few days later we received a
letter from DS informing us of their patent application PCT-DS_ They also told us that
PCT-DS had validly entered the European phase in January 2008 and that all
prescribed fees, including the designation fees for all EPC contracting states, had been
paid. Our patent manager has been invited to a meeting with DS on the 28.03_2008_
The damage caused by the fire was so severe that our patent files were only
reconstructed on 28.02_2008, allowing the patent department to resume working. On
that day we became aware of a notification from the EPO dated 17.122007 and
received at our company on 21.122007 informing us that the necessary filing and
search fees had not been paid for EP2 and that, therefore, EP2 was deemed to be
withdrawn. We have checked and found that the fees for only EPI were paid.
Having re-constituted our files, we also realised on 28.022008 that pages 3 and 4 of
the description were missing from patent application EPI. The content of these pages is
present in DKI and is essential to carry out the invention and to manufacture the racket
damper Dl Othervvise EPI is identical in content to DKI. We have not received any
communication from the EPO on this matter.
