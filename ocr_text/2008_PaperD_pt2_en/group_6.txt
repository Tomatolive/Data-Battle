Yesterday BEP contacted our patent manager in order to investigate whether we were
interested in buying the patent rights to racket damper D2 According to BEP, FR-BEP
is still pending. It turned out that BEP had also filed a European patent application EP-
BEP on 04.092006 claiming priority of and being identical with FR-BEP_ For EP-BEP,
which has not been published, all filing requirements have been met except for paying
the necessary filing and search fees.
We were further informed that BEP has been declared bankrupt as from 06.092006 by
a decision of a French tribunal Since that date BEP has been prevented by legal
reasons from continuing the proceedings before the EPO, which, however, was never
informed about the company's legal situation. Yesterday BEP were authorized to sell
their assets to meet their debts.
It is essential for us to have the best protection possible for our technology and all
