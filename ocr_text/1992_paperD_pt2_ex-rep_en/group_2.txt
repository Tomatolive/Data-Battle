Section
(A simple and fundanental natter)
Feature is a subject of GB—K and has priority 3 June 1991, that
is before loss Of chip. EP—L publication in March 1992 before
loss of Tester, involved publication of certified copy of GB—K.
Thus Titanic cannot avoid total anticipation of Feature if they
file nov. Abacus can avoid anticipation by filing a new EP
application and claining priori ty from GB—K. This must be before
3 June 1992, but preferably at once with a request for
accelerated publication and prosecution in Order to obtain rights
to stop Titanic. (No need to discuss conplicated actions under
Article 61 EPC).
Section B
Too late to correct designation in EP—L: J2i/84: application
Published. EP—N possible but sufficiently early to give warning
to others and only if also in parent application. Request under
Rule 88 EPC should be made as soon as possible. Inspect file to
be certain Of designations and dates.
Section CI
Appeal validly filed, but grounds due 16 March 1992 (14 March
Saturday) . Inspect file for letter received 16 March. Sufficient
to constitute Grounds (Tl 3/82) ? Unlikely. But if sufficient,
could lead to Board Of Appeal deciding to grant patent. If not,
was letter received 1 April sufficient as request for
in integrum? If so, and this is granted, patent could be granted,
but Abacus could argue for rights under Article 122(6) EPC if
conditions satisfied.
Section cZ
PCT application published in Japanese with English language
abstract. German language abstract suggests another application
(DE, AT?). Check. Deadline 31 months for fil ing translation. Now
36 nontns. can apply for in ilXegzun: J12/87. Although
this is excluded for time limit of Article 94 (2) by Article
122(5) , this does not apply for Euro—PCT cases. If restoration
allowed, Abacus may benefit fron Article 122(6) if satisfied.
