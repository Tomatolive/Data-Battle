1.
A 87 (1) EPC gives a right of priority for filing in or for any State party
to the Paris Convention.
A 8(1) PCT provides the right to claim priority in an international applica-
tion, again from an application filed in or for any country party to the
Paris Convention.
Taiwan is not party to the Paris Convention.
(a) The priority claim is val ld. The PCT appl ication vas filed within one
year of the first ing in a State party to the Paris Convention.
A 8(2) (a) PCT ensures A 4 Of the parLs Convention applies.
The applicant vas the same in all cases, fulfilling the requirement Of
A 87(1) EPC. Switzerland is a Contracting State of PCT giving the
individual the right to file a PCT application by virtue of his
nationality (Article 9(1) PCT).
(b) National law, EPC, is ultimately determinative. A utility model can give
a valid right to priority - A 87 (1) EPC. Here A 87 (4) EPC would apply.
Assuming the utility model application vere not withdrawn, abandoned or
refused by the patent application filed, and Without being open to
public inspection without leaving any rights outstanding nor serving as
a basis for claiming a right of priority, there is no valid claim, as
far as EPC States are concerned.
2. A 60(2) EPC gives the right to the European patent to the person whose
European application has the earliest date of filing. A 89 EPC indicates
that the date of priority shall count as Che date of filing for this
purpose .
A 60(2) applies only in respect of States designated.
A therefore has the right for FR, DK, IT, SE.
B has the prior right for ML.
For Gerrnany, national lav counts and A 4 Paris Convention gives the right of
priority to A, who has the earlier priority date - 4/1/93 - and so the right
to the German parent .
3. (a) The Decision of the EPO President dated 26/5/92 allovs documents to be
filed by facsimile under R 36(5) EPC.
R 36(3) requires a notice of opposition to be signed, since it applies
to opposition proceedings by virtue of R 61a. If a document is not
signed, the original date of receipt is kept if it is signed within a
time-limit set by the EPO (R 36(3) second and third sentences) .
The notice therefore get the date Of fax filing (by analogy Vith
Legal Advice 13/82 one should be able to file the signed document before
the Invitation to do so received) .
