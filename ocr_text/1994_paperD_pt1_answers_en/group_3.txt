By A 79(2), applying the A 78(2) period, the fee for DK Vas subject to
payment of the fee by one month after - 3 Feb. 94 (no R 850) (a)
extension - all EPO Offices open)
R 85a(2) enables the fee to be paid (as discussed) by 2 months from
3 Feb. 94. I.e. 3 April 1994.
However, this was a Sunday and at least one EPO Office Within the
meaning of A 78(1) (a) was closed on 4 April and so R 85(1) extends the
time-limit to (today) .
- pay the fee and surcharge today.
(b) 30/12/93 plus 1 month 30/1/94, which is a Sunday therefore R 85(1)
extends the normal period to 1 February 1994.
R 85a(2) grace period is calculated from the expiry Of the normal period
therefore grace period expires 1 April 1994, except this was Good Friday
- the EPO Was closed 1, 2, 3 and April and R 85a(I) extends the grace
period to 5 April 1994.
Therefore same answer as (a).
(c) Different - designation fee would then be due 12 months after filing -
4 Jan 1994 (A 79(2)).
The 2-month grace period would then have expired on 4 March 1994.
Therefore would be too late for DK.
- A 79(2) - no fee, no designation Of DK.
The fees may be paid by any person (Legal Advice 6/91 with regard to
A 7 (1) Rules relating to Fees). Simplest would be for the Kunich representative
to pay the fees in (a) and (b).
6. (a) Withdraw approval Of text - R 51 (6) comunication Cannot be issued
(T 1/92
- it must be established beyond any doubt that applicant agrees
text): A 113(2) requires that the EPO can only decide on text agreed by
the applicant. Simultaneously request an amendment to overcome the prior
art and give approval to the text to the amendment being made.
If the amendment is not allowed, examination should be resumed. (The
Guidelines confirm that, exceptionally, this will happen where there are
nev reasons to doubt validity Of the R 51(4) claims.)
G 7/93 is currently pending on the question of whether approval given by
the applicant under R 51 (4) is binding. However, the public interest
- the EPO should not grant patents it knovs to be
should be protected
inval ld, where it still has the chance to resume examination
proceedings.
(b) Too late for action as in (a).
Instead - self opposition. A 99(1) - any person may oppose, confirmed by
G 1/84 to include the patent proprietor. Oppose own patent
publication of mention Of grant and within the A 99(1) period, On the
