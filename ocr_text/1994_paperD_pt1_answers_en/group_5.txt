By R 78(1) notifications are by registered mail
— to a professional
representative under R 81.
R 83(2) provides chat computation of a time-limit, where the relevant event
is a notification, Ls from receipt Of the notification. By R 78(3), a
registered letter within an EPO Contracting State (e.g. to a professional
representative), is deemed to be del Lvered on 10th day following posting.
Thus, the O-month period has not yet expired (there may be as much as 10
days left) and a R 84 request for an extension be granted - no fee
payabl e.
If even more time is needed, the further processing route outlined above
could be used to gain more time on payment of the fee required by A 121 (2)
Which Ls DM 150 or equivalent (A 2 No, 12 RRF).
A request under R 84 for a further extension beyond the 2 months taking the
period up to 6 months, would probably be refused - see Notice of Vice-
President DG 2 and Guidelines, as above.
R 90(1)(a) provides for interruption of proceedings Ln the event of death of
the applicant.
J ./87 has indicated that such interruption does apply to the grace period
for paying renewal fees, notwithstanding R 90(4) (in line with J 7/83).
However, here the applicant has not died. The transfer from A to B has no
effect vis-å-vLs the EPO, by virtue of R 20(3), since no request from the
transfer to be recorded under R 20(1) has been received by the EPO, neither
has the fee required by R 20(2) been paid.
A is the applicant vis-å-vis the EPO, therefore no interruption. Therefore
the application is deemed withdrawn - A 86(3), A 121 (further processing)
does not apply because the time-limit was not set by the Office.
Legal advice 18/92 appl icant may initiate processing.
- 21 months deadline - here 10 Jan 94.
