If the application is filed at the EPO, priority documents will not be required, simply
a request that the EPO transmits priority documents to the 1B (PCT Rule 17. I(b)). If
filed at a National office priority documents will need to be filed within 16 months
from priority (PCT Rule 17 _ I(a)). The effect of non-filing Of priority of documents is
that priority may be refused by National offices (PCT Rule 17.1(c)) although this is
not the effect before the EPO (EPC Rule 104b(3)) where priority documents will be
requested if they are not filed at the time of entry into the National Phase.
(ii) EP(I) appears to be an enabling disclosure for broad claims to opto-electronic devices
since the description of EP(I) was sufficient to allow experts to manufacture a device
falling under such broad claims given reasonable experimentation (T 14/83 and
T226/85). In contrast, for the specific devices X and Y, the basis for claims to these
devices is found in EP(2).
In summary, in the PCT application to be filed, broad claims should be drafted for
opto-electric devices which include the improved optical fibres as justified by the
disclosure of EP(I), together with specific claims to X and Y, as justified by the
disclosure Of EP(2). It should be noted that under your agreement with GLAZECO
your company only has the right to claims for devices.
The new developments by NEWMAN would appear to be patentable in their own right
(see Guidelines C IV 9.4(i), T 2/83 - evidence Of inventive step and novelty exists so
far as you are aware). It may be useful to include these developments in the single
application now with the option to divide out later so as to minimise costs in the first
year, provided that NEWMAN can provide the necessary documentation in time for
filing on the 18.04.95. However, a separate, non-convention application could be filed
later if the details of the NEWMAN developments are not available in time. Claims
could be incorporated for the specific device, the manufacturing process and for use
Of the polarisation feature in improving the performance of devices X and Y
(iii) To be safe you should claim priority of both EP(I) and EP(2). For the broad claims
to opto-electric devices. the priority of EP(I) must be claimed, while as far as the
specific device claims are concerned, EP(2) is the first application where devices X
and Y are mentioned explicitly. EP(I) does not explicitly disclose the specific features
of devices X or Y. The requirements for an implicit disclosure Of these features (see
GL C-IV 7.5) are probably not fulfilled either, since the client's letter does not say that
the skilled man would inevitably arrive at a device having the specific features Of
device X or Y when carrying out the general procedure described in EP(I), but just
that he could develop a device corresponding to the general description (Paris
Convention Art. 4, PCT Art. 8(1), Art. 87(1) EPC). Therefore, only the priority of
EP(2) can be claimed for the devices X and Y.
The priority of EP(I) should in any event be claimed for the following reasons: Firstly,
if it is not claimed, there is the risk of an EPC Art. 54(3) conflict with the application
claiming only the EP(2) priority; secondly, EP(2) is not a "first application" with
regard to the broad claims within the terms of EPC Art. 87(1) so that for these claims
its priority cannot be validly claimed (withdrawal of EP(I ) before its publication would
be of no help pursuant to EPC Art. 87(4) because GLAZECO will file a new
application claiming the priority of EP(I)); hence, the disclosures at the conference
