(11) The FLASHCO applications
(i) In respect of the device the FLASHCO PCT(F) application appears to be compromised
outside the US, and certainly for the EPC by virtue of the alleged disclosure of the
FLASHCO device at the trade fair. However, in the absence Of any dated documentary
evidence, this will need to be decided on the basis of a witness testimony or affidavit.
The question is whether supporting evidence will be available from unrelated parties
who were at the fair. Testimony by your company's employees alone would not
necessarily be sufficient to prove the prior disclosure. However, PCT(F) claims for the
device would only have priority Of so the device priority Of 21.04.94 of your
(EP(2) application will prevail and the BRIGHTCO new application will be EPC
Art. 54(3) prior art for novelty against PCT(F) on entry into the EP regional phase in
so far as there are common designations, so it is probable that FLASHCO will need
a licence from you in Europe. Evidence Of the disclosure at the trade fair will not
prevent grant of a US patent because of the US grace period for such disclosures. (On
the other hand, your company is likely to end up with an interference action in the US
based on your own PCT application). It is possible that FLASHCO could get a claim
to the fibre per se accepted in the European regional phase of PCT (F); your fibre
supplier would then need to be FLASHCO or would have to have a licence from
FLASHCO.
(ii) Progress of PCT(F) can only be monitored at published stages. It should already have
been published. It can be checked whether the demand is actually filed and which
states are elected for PCT CHII such that PCT Art. 39(1 )(a) additional delay would be
available (i.e. election made prior to 19 months from priority i.e. 21.04_95)_ If
FLASHCO have demanded an IPE by 21.04_95 then the period for entering EP
regional phase will be extended to 31 months from priority (EPC Art. 150(3), EPC
Rule 104b(l), PCT Art. As 21_04.96 is a Sunday, the 31 month time-limit
is extended to 22.04.96 (EPC Rule 85(1)). Demand information is published in
accordance with PCT Rule 61.4 (and available on EPIDOS after publication of WO
specification). Otherwise the regional phase before EPO will need to be entered by
21.05.95 under EPC Art 1500), EPC Rule 104b(l), PCT Art. 22, which is extended
under EPC Rule 85(1) to 22.05.95. The ICE is confidential - PCT Art. 38(2). so no
information will be available on the progress of the ICE unless FLASHCO allows it
be.
The PCT has no provision comparable to EPC Art. 115 allowing for filing of
observations Or evidence by Others. In any event, the IPEA is only required to consider
prior art in the form of written (i.e. not oral ) disclosure PCT Art. 33(2), PCT Rule 64
(although attention may be drawn to written disclosures referring to oral disclosures).
Ihe International Preliminary Examination gives a non-binding opmion and does not
have the effect of a grant (PCT Art. 33(1)). Therefore, you should withhold any
observations or evidence until such time as the PCT(F) enters the national/regional
phases and evidence can be presented before national/regional offices. Before the EPO,
you could use either EPC Art. 115 dunng prosecution and leave it to the EPO
Examiner to make the case (you would not then be a party to the proceedings) and/or
wait to oppose under EPC Art. IOO(a), in order to have the best chance Of fully
presenting your case against FLASIICO, by becoming a party to the proceedings.
