notification of the decision, and within four months of the date Of notification of the decision
should file a written statement setting out the grounds of appeal. The two month time-limit for
the notice of appeal begins on the 17.02.1995 (date Of dispatch plus 10 days (Rule 78(3)) and
ends On the 17.041995, Easter Monday, but is further extended to the 18.04.1995 (Rule 85(1).
The four-month time-limit for the grounds Of appeal ends on the 17/06/95, a Saturday, and so is
extended under Rule 85(1) to 19.06.1995.
Amended claims which conform with what the examiner has indicated as being allowable should
be filed with the grounds of appeal- The examining division should then take advantage of the
provision for Interlocutory Revision (Art. 109 EPC), and provided it regards the appeal to be
admissible and well founded (i.e. overcoming the previous objections), the decision to refuse the
application will be reversed (Art. 109 EPC).
Regarding the issue of fees, the first renewal fee was due on 3101.1995 (last day of month in
which second anniversary of filing date falls (Rule 37(1 in accordance with Art 86(1 ) EPC and
is now overdue. The renewal fee may still be validly paid within six months of this date provided
that a 10% surcharge is paid at the same time (Art 86(2)). The renewal fee should therefore be
paid before the 31.07.1995.
Memorandum to BRIGHTCO
(I) The proposed new device application
(i) Given your desire to minimise costs, I would recommend a PCT application
designating Europe, Australia, Japan and USA, which would appear to be the most
cost effective route. The application Can be made at the European Patent Offce, at the
appropriate National Patent Office (PCT Art 10, PCT Rule 19) e.g. the British Patent
Office, or WIPO (national security provisions may require a filing at the British Patent
Office). The application could be filed by fax at the EPO - with the exception of
authorisations and priority documents (PCT Rule 92.4, Decision of the President dated
26.05.1992 (OJ EPO 1992, 299) and Notice from the EPO dated 02.06.1992 (OJ EPO
1992, 306)) - and this might also be possible at National offices dependent upon their
home provisions.
The PCT route is particularly cost-effective for a number Of reasons. As the EPO is
the International Searching Authority then no EP search fee will be required in
addition to the PCT search fee (Administrative Council decision per EPC
Art. As the priority applications are European applications a refund or a
partial refund of the search fee is available. If the EPO subsequently acts as
International preliminary Examination Authority then EP examination fee can also be
reduced by 50% EPC Rule 104b(6) RRF Art. 12(2). I would suggest that you
postpone payment of the EP designation fees by not entering the EP regional phase
until you absolutely need to. Only four (lower) designation fees would then be payable
early for the PCT, whilst up to 15 (higher) designation fees would be payable in a
similar time frame if an EP application was filed from the beginning.
