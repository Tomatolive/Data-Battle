Report on Paner D/199S
It is difflcult to know what it is worth saying which would help future candidates in preparing
for the exams. Despite the comments in previous reports, the same problems turn up year after
year and it must be emphasised that it would be preferable if candidates did not enter the exam
until they were really ready and had put in the necessary study
Once again it was venâ€¢ regrettable to read answers which displayed such a complete lack of
knowledge of priority rights - who owned them and what was to claim them to
maximum benefit This is a major issue for the correct handling of a client's patent matters and
any candidate who cannot deal with this is not fit to practice. Also a surprisingly common failing
was for a candidate to know old case law but not to know the most recent decisions or EPC
changes reversing the old law.
No well prepared candidate should have been short of time and the need this year to allocate time
between the different parts was avoided by separating them and specifically allocating a
maximum time for each part. Overall, the examiners felt the papers showed that there had been
less time pressure and that part II in particular was answered better this year, probably as a result
of more time being allocated specifically for this part without the question having been made in
any way more difficult. Nevertheless, many candidates would havA10st valuable rights for their
clients if they had been dealing with these problems in real life.
Attached is a model answer which is much fuller than would be expected from even very good
candidates. Also attached are examples Of some Of the better actual examination answers which
were submitted in different languages. These actual examples may suffer errors or omisslons and
may not accord with the model answer in all respects but they do show what actually can and
has been achieved by good preparation and in the time permitted in the examination.
Many of the questions in Part I were well answered and obviously caused candidates very few
problems but others were not found so universally easy and the following comments set out the
main problems or deficiencies that arose in the answers.
