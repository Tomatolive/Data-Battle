Part
What the examiners were looking for comes out in the model answer. In the majority of cases
they did not get what they wanted.
Candidates should preferably read the paper through completely before starting their answer and
they would then save time wnting down unnecessao' material. They might also then realise that
they have been set specific questions which they should assume the examiners expect to be
answered if they are to get good marks. Most tailed to follow the questions through and many
finished up Setting their Clients questions rather than giving advice and answers. When advice
was given it was Often given without justification or basis. The candidates need to say why a
particular course is being recommended and if they do so they might realise how wrong some
of their proposals are.
Candidates were expected to try to provide their clients with the best protection available and this
did involve claiming the priority Of EPL so many ignored this and some clearly decided to take
the easiest course which involved the least work and effort for the attomey and to throw away
rights by giving up any claim to rights on broad devices and on X and Y and simply choosing
to protect Newman's Invention Ownership of priority was dealt with very badly and the great
majority still overlook that a right to priority or a right to claim priority is necessary before it can
be validly claimed.
The part of the question dealing with Flashco's position was dealt with very badly or only
superficially by a large number of candidates. Very few showed a knowledge of PCT procedures
or of the US grace period.
