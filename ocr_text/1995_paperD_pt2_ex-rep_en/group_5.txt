would be prior art against the broad claims Of an application claiming only the priority
of EP(2).
As the priority Of EP(I) is to be claimed as well as that Of EP(2), then the PCT filing
claiming priority should be made by 14_04_ 1995, but this is Good Friday, followed by
the weekend and Easter Monday, which are all holidays, so the time for filing is
extended under PCT Rule 80.5 until Tuesday 18.04.95 (Rule
NEWMAN's developments are not entitled to the priorities Of EP(I) Or EP(2) since
they are not implicitly or explicitly disclosed in these documents. In any case, in view
of G3/93, there is no benefit in claiming the priorities of I ) and/or EP(2) for these
developments since the intervening disclosures at the conference will be citable against
any claims to NEWMAN's developments.
(iv) The applicants need to be in a position to claim priority from EP(I) and EP(2)_ The
right to claim convention priority is extended under Paris Convention Article 4, as
implemented in EPC Art. 87(1) and PCT Art. 8(1), to the original applicant or his
successor in title.
In order to validly claim the priorities of EP(I ) and EP(2) it is, however, not necessary
to keep these applications in force; EPC Art. 87(3). [f the application were to be made
in BRIGHTCO's name only, the assignment of EP(2) and EP(I) (at least in part), or
of the right to claim prioriw, would be required by 18.04.1995; Rule 20(3) EPC.
However, there is no signatory available so that the best solution would be to file the
PCT application in the joint names of GLAZECO and BRIGHTCO and then have
GLAZECO assign its rights formally after filing. If the NEWMAN invention is added
to the PCT application BRIGHTCO will in any case need to be named as a co-
applicant, By adopting this route the right to priority can be preserved as the applicant
of EP(I) and EP(2) (GLAZECO) is also an applicant for the new application.
Where there are several applicants, an agent representing all of them may be appointed
by designation in the request or by a separate power of attorney or by a combinaüon
Of both methods, provided that all the applicants have signed either the request or a
separate power of attorney (PCT Art. PCT Rule 4. 90.4(a)).
Therefore, there will be a need for a signature on the request Or a separate power Of
attorney on behalf of GLAZECO as well as BRIGHTCO for all countries except US,
and by the inventors for the US.
Both KAPPA and LAMBDA would need to be named as inventors (and applicants for
the USA) and two assignments will be required - one assignment of their part-share
in the PCT application from GLAZECO to BRIGHTCO and one assignment from
KAPPA and LAMBDA for the US part of the PCT application.
If the NEWMAN claims are incorporated in the PCT application, NEWMAN must be
added as an inventor and applicant for the United States and this would modiö' the
assignments required. If the NEWMAN invention is not included in the single PCT
application, but is claimed in a separate national or European application, then that
application can be made in the name of BRIGHTCO alone.
