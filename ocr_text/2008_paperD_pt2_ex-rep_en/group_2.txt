1 Current leqal situation (22 marks):
Sports racket R and tennis racket RI: IN-DS is the earliest application for spons racket
R. Furthermore, India was member of the Paris Convention at the relevant date.
Consequently, IN-DS can serve as priority application for PCT-DS even in the European
regional phase. The effective date of sports racket R therefore is 10.12.05
The same applies for tennis racket RI, even though the claims of IN-DS or PCT-DS are
directed to the spons racket in general and not to the specific example of tennis racket RI
There is no prior art for PCT-DS
The first filing by CopenTennis (CT) for tennis racket RI is DK-IJ_ The priority claims of
EPI and EP2 are invalid with respect to RI , since DKI and DK2 are not the first filings by
CT for RI Consequently, the effective dates for tennis racket RI in EPI and EP2 are the
respective filing dates.
The publication of DK-U, DKI , DK2 as well as PCT-DS is novelty destroying for the claims
to the tennis racket RI alone in EPI and EP2
As Euro-PCT-DS designates DK it will be an earlier right for DK-U, DKI and DK2 with
respect to tennis racket RI
In summary, DS can obtain patent protection in all PCT (in particular EP) member states
for sports racket R and its specific embodiment RI and can in almost any country block us
from manufacturing and selling RI once the patents resulting from PCT-DS are granted
and, if applicable, validated.
Racket damper Dl: DKI is the first filing for racket damper Dl. The priority claim of EPI
is valid With respect to Dl; the effective date is the filing date of DKI , i.e. 27.12_06_
If published, EP-BEP will be prior art under Art. 54(3) EPC for damper Dl of EPI in
Europe. Moreover, PR-BEP is a national prior right with respect to EPI , which is not
considered for novelty and inventive step in EP proceedings.
However, racket damper Dl is clearly different from and operates on a different principle to
racket damper D2_ Therefore it appears to be new over D2. The French patent resulting
from EPI can be maintained in France in view of FR-BEP.
Since there is no prior art disclosing racket damper Dl , the claim to Dl is new.
Because of the missing pages EPI does not have an enabling disclosure of racket damper
Dl (Art. 83 EPC)_
