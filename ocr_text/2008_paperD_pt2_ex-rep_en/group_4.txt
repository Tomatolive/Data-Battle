2 Recommended actions within the next three months (26.5 marks):
With respect to racket damper Dl the EPC allows to introduce missing pages (R. 56(2)
and (3) EPC, see also Guidelines A-II, 5.2 and 5.4) if
- the applicant files the nmssing pages,
- the applicant requests that the late-filed parts be based on the claimed priority to avoid a
change in the date of filing,
- the late filed parts are completely contained in the claimed priority application, i.e. DKI ,
- the applicant files a copy of the priority application,
- the applicant files a translation of the priority application into an official EPO language,
- the applicant indicates where in the priority application and its translation the late filed
missing parts are completely contained.
The above should have been done within 2 months from filing date, i.e. until 15.02_08_ This
time limit has expired.
An omission of a communication under R. 56 EPC from the EPO may not be invoked, it
would be too risky to wait for it
The expired time limit of R. 56(2) EPC is open to re-establishment, which can be
requested within 2 months after 2802.08, i.e. until 2804.08.
Within that time limit
- request re-establishment,
- state the grounds and facts why the "all due care" requirement is met, which is likely in
view of the facts (fire, backup, review meetings),
- pay the prescribed fee and
- complete the omitted act by fulfilling all of the above requirements of R. 56(2) and (3)
EPC
Consequently, CT can obtain patent protection in Europe for racket damper Dl and can
stop any competitor from manufacturing and selling Dl including R+DI and RI+DI, once
EPI is granted and validated
In view of the plans of DS to start selling rackets R or RI including damper D2 in Europe
CT should buy the patent rights of BEP.
This will give protection in France for racket damper D2 resulting from FR-BEP. DS is
offenng R+D2 and RI +D2 for sale, which fall under the scope of FR-BEP.
EP-BEP would give equivalent protection Europe wide, if revived.
Since the applicant of EP-BEP was bankrupt as from 06.09_2006 the EPO will interrupt the
proceedings on that day as soon as it is informed and provided with evidence.
Conclude the agreement with BEP and inform the EPO that
CT is the new owner of BEP's patent rights,
BEP was bankrupt as from 0609.2006.
Evidence suppofting the bankruptcy and the transfer of the patent rights has to be filed.
Moreover, a fee for registering the transfer has to be paid.
