The EPO will then communicate a date on which the proceedings of EP-BEP are resumed.
The one month time limit for paying the filing and search fees for EP-BEP will begin again
on that day. Make sure that these fees are paid in time.
To obtain protection for grip G in Europe in addition to Denmark, EP2, claiming priority of
DK2, has to be saved. EP2 was filed on 14.11.07 under EPC 1973, the time limit for
paying the filing and search fees ended on 14.1207 when the EPC 2000 was already in
force. Following the transitional provisions the legal remedy for the loss of rights is
according to EPC 2000.
Consequently, further processing can be requested for the time limit for paying the filing
and search fees. The time limit for requesting further processing is two months from
receipt of the notification of loss of rights and ended on 27.0208
The time limit of fulther processing is open to re-establishment, which has to be requested
within 2 months from 28.0208, i.e. by 2804.08
Within that time limit request re-establishment with respect to the time limit for further
processing, take the necessary steps including paying the fee for fufther processing.
Consequently, CT can obtain patent protection in Europe for G and can block DS from
selling any rackets equipped with grip G, including R+G and RI+G, in Europe once EP2 is
granted and validated.
3 Suqqestions for a strateqv for the negotiations with DS (11.5 marks):
In preparation of the meeting with DS the status of PCT-DS should be checked via file
inspectiom Furthermore, it is advisable to watch out for the publication of further patent
applications.
Moreover, you should file the requests for re-establishment as soon as possible. Try to
reach an agreement with BEP and carry out the necessary steps to have the transfer done
before the meeting with DS.
You have to be aware that CT has been incurring a potential liability to pay compensation
in respect of PCT-DS as from its publication by selling RI+DI +G_
Also DS could be in a difficult situation since they may have been infringing DKI and DK2
by offering for sale of RI or R in combination with Dl and/or G.
You should consider early publication of EPI and EP2 as well as filing a translation of the
claims where appropriate for provisional protection. Please be aware that provisional
protection resulting from a pending patent application depends on national law.
Furthermore, you could consider requesting accelerated prosecution of your EP
applications under PACE
