Racket damper 02: FR-BEP is the first application for racket damper D2.
The priority period of FR-BEP ended on Sunday, 0309.06, extended to 04.09_06_ The
priority of FR-BEP in EP-BEP was therefore claimed in time. The effective date for EP-
BEP is the filing date of FR-BEP
With respect to EP-BEP the time limit for paying the filing and search fees ended one
month after the filing date, i.e. on 04.1006.
Since the filing and search fees were not paid EP-BEP is deemed to be withdrawn.
As there is no prior an disclosing D2, the claim to racket damper D2 appears to be new
and inventive.
Grip G: DK2 is CT's first filing for grip G. The priority claim of EP2 is valid with respect to
G; the effective date is the filing date of DK2, i.e. 29.12_06_
Since there is no prior art disclosing grip G, the claim to G appears to be new and
Inventive _
However, EP2 is deemed to be withdrawn as the filing and search fees have not been paid
for this application.
The mentioned combinations of R or RI with any of Dl, D2 and G:
Since the claims to racket damper Dl and grip G as such are new and inventive, also the
claims directed to the combinations of tennis racket RI with racket damper Dl and/or grip
G are new and inventive.
No application specifically discloses the combinations of RI+DI+G, Rl+D2 or sports
racket R with any of Dl, D2 and G.
Further applications directed to Rl+D2 or R with any of Dl , D2 and G would not be new in
view of the DS press release.
An application directed to RI+DI+G would not be new in view of CT's sales.
Consequently, filing further applications directed to the above subject-matter does not
make sense.
All combinations offered for sale by CT and DS include R or RI and therefore fall under
the scope of protection of PCT-DS; since they additionally contain Dl , D2 and/or G they
also fall under the scope of protection of the patent applications based on DKI , FR-BEP
and/or DK2.
