Even if you are active in Europe only you can take advantage of the grace periods in the
US and other countries by filing respective patent applications to improve your negotiation
position with DS
Since CT cannot manufacture or sell tennis racket RI in almost any country in the world
they need a license for RI from DS.
Also DS cannot sell any of their rackets having G, Dl or D2, in particular R or RI with G,
Dl or D2, in Europe without a license from CT.
DS have a strong negotiating position also because CT can only stop them in Europe,
which is only a potential market, while DS can stop CT in their entire market and only
place of business.
Cross-licensing seems unavoidable One of the possible cross-licensing agreements
includes a license for tennis racket RI for CT in exchange for licenses for other rackets
(squash, badminton) equipped with Dl, D2 and/or G for DS.
