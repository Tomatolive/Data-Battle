Examiners' Report Paper D 2008 Part II
This was the first EQE after entry into force of EPC 2000. Most Candidates demonstrated
to be well familiar with the new provisions and thus they were able to collect most of the
marks available for EPC 2000 issues, both in Dl and in D2
Crucial aspects of this years D2 paper were the analysis of subject-matter, validity of
priority, the new provisions of EPC 2000, interruption of proceedings and the scope of
protection of the various patents or patent applications.
The analysis of subject-matter and the question on validity of priorities were very well dealt
with. In particular, most candidates knew that at the relevant date India was member of the
Paris Convention and that the EPO would therefore accept the priority claim of an Indian
patent application. Many also recognized that the priority claims of EPI and EP2 were
invalid in respect of RI because DKI and DK2 were not the first applications for this
subject matter.
A majority of candidates also demonstrated a sound knowledge of the new provisions of
EPC 2000, in particular the legal remedies Nevertheless, marks were lost if candidates
did not suggest the necessary steps, e.g for filing the missing parts and obtaining re-
establishment
Although most candidates were generally aware of the possibility of interrupting the
proceedings in case of bankruptcy, only few could correctly apply the legal provisions of
Rule 142 EPC For example, many candidates were of the opinion that it was not
necessary to inform the EPO about the bankruptcy and that the proceedings would be
interrupted automatically. Also the fact that the EPO specifies the date of resumption of
proceedings and that the (full) period for paying the search and filing fees starts again on
that day were often missed.
Frequently, marks were lost on analysing the protection conferred by the various patents
or patent applications. Surprisingly, a number of candidates were of the opinion that a
claim directed to the sports racket in general would not protect the specific example of a
tennis racket and considered it necessary to include a dependent 0) claim on a tennis
racket to extend protection on the tennis racket. Even if a dependent claim can be added
as fallback position, it does not change the scope of protection.
Some candidates also stated that CT had protection for the damper Dl via EPI and were
therefore allowed to sell the combination of RI+DI although Euro-PCT-DS by their
competitor DS covered tennis racket RI .
Furthermore, it was often overlooked that both CT and DS have been violating provisional
rights by selling or offering for sale rackets covered by the claims in their competitors
published applications.
Finally, although most of the candidates recognized that a cross-licensing agreement
would be the best way to proceed, they did nevertheless not state which rights would be
pan of the agreement. It is reminded once again that simply proposing cross-licensing
without details about the rights to be exchanged is not enough for earning full marks.
