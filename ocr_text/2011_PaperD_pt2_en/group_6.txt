I sent off a debit order to the EPO for the further search fee immediately after receiving
the invitation to pay the additional fee and told our accounts department to pay the
amount of the fee into our deposit account. Unfortunately, I found out yesterday that a
fax notifying us of a sh01tfall in the deposit account was received and passed straight to
our accounts department on 26 January 2011. They have told me that our deposit
account was replenished on 24 February 2011. It is our usual procedure to send faxes
relating to the deposit account straight to our accounts department, but in this case I
wish I had seen the fax, because it says something about an administrative fee to be
paid.
1) Please analyse our present position as far as patent protection in Europe for
the various aspects of our developments is concerned. For which aspects of
our developments can we obtain patent protection in Europe, and how?
2) Please analyse whether Pankutaya could obtain valid patent protection that
would pose a threat to our European activities.
Now I come to the appeal. We were granted a European patent, EP-Ax, to a newly
developed brake lever. We developed this brake lever for use in combination with either
disc brakes or rim brakes. When we developed the brake lever, we had mechanical disc
brakes and mechanical rim brakes in mind, in which the brake force generated with the
brake lever is transmitted by steel cables to the disc or rim brakes. However, we thought
at the time that the brake lever might also be suitable for use with hydraulic disc brakes
or hydraulic rim brakes, in which the braking force is transmitted by hydraulic oil to the
disc or rim brakes, but we did not get round to testing this possibility.
