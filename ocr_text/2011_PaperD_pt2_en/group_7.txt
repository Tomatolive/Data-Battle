The first claim of the granted patent was to the special brake lever, and there was also a
claim to a bicycle brake system including at least one brake lever according to the first
claim. The description of EP-Ax merely indicates that the brake lever is for use in a
bicycle brake system of the type having at least one disc brake. However, there is no
description or picture of any bicycle, nor is there any mention of rim brakes.
Pankutaya opposed EP-Ax on grounds of lack of novelty on the basis of their earlier
European patent application, EP-PAN2, which is state of the art under Art 54 (3) EPC It
discloses and claims a bicycle with the same brake lever as ours and with hydraulic rim
brakes. It includes a very detailed drawing of the brake lever. Therefore, in addition to
our main request to reject the opposition, we filed an auxiliary request limiting the
independent claim of EP-Ax to a bicycle brake system with the special brake lever, and
with a disclaimer to disclaim bicycle brake systems in which the brake lever is used to
actuate hydraulic brakes. EP-Ax was maintained by the Opposition Division in amended
form in accordance with our auxiliary request.
As a matter of fact, the bicycle described in EP-PAN2 was never put on the market The
reason for this is that it is impossible to make a functioning brake system with hydraulic
rim brakes and the brake lever.
We have not yet appealed the interlocutory decision of the Opposition Division, but the
period for appeal has not yet expired. Pankutaya immediately appealed and also filed
their statement of grounds of appeal. In the statement they only argue that the subject-
matter of the claim of EP-Ax is insufficiently disclosed because a functioning bicycle
brake system fitted with the brake lever in combination with a hydraulic rim brake cannot
be made. We accept that this is true. We have done our own tests and found that this
problem does not affect brake systems using our brake lever in combination with
mechanical rim or disk brakes or hydraulic disk brakes.
