As a precaution, our developers have been instructed to file a copy of what is submitted
to the standardisation committee as a U.S. provisional patent application. In this case,
such an application, hereafter referred to as USP-Ax, was filed by Alice on the same day
(1 February 2010), naming herself and Bob as applicants and inventors. At the same
time, she filed a declaration of assignment, signed by Bob and Alice, of USP-Ax to
Axbruch GmbH. Ten months later, and in accordance with our normal procedure, Alice
notified me of what she had filed, so that I could judge whether we should file further
patent applications.
In this case, I did nothing, because there had not been any changes to the axle unit as
already fully disclosed in an international patent application PCT-Ax. I filed this
application with the EPO on 2 November 2010, in the name of Axbruch GmbH, naming
Alice and Bob as inventors. PCT-Ax claims priority from DE-Ak
Claim 1 of PCT-Ax is an independent claim to an axle unit with the special seal S and a
lubricant composition comprising a combination of silicone oil and a viscosity index
improver. Claim 2 is dependent on claim 1, and additionally specifies that the axle
decreases in diameter towards its ends. Claim 3 is dependent on claim 2, and specifies
the pentagonal cross-section of the axle ends, whereas claim 4 is dependent on claim 2
and specifies the cross-shaped cross-section of the axle ends. The description and
drawings of PCT-Ax were based on those of DE-Ax, but limited to axle units with a
lubricant composition which is a combination of silicone oil and a viscosity index
improver. We also added the results of our tests.
We have received an invitation to pay a further search fee in respect of the subject-
matter of claim 4, dated 23 January 2011 and accompanied by a partial international
search report citing JPIJ-PANI_ JPU-PANI is a Japanese utility model with a filing date
of 15 July 2009 which was published on 21 October 2009. EP-PANI, an application filed
on 1 July 2010 by reference to JPU-PANI, claimng priority from JPLJ-PANI and
published early in January 2011 is cited as evidence of the contents of JPU-PANI.
