You receive the following letter from the director of Axbruch GmbH, a manufacturer of
bicycle components, based in Germany:
We are a globally active supplier of bicycle components. Our major competitor is
Pankutaya Japan K_K, a conglomerate with manufacturing and research facilities in
Japan and the Netherlands.
I am responsible for patenting, but I find this work rather difficult I have had to represent
the company in an opposition, which has not gone well and which is now at the appeal
stage. I will come back to this later, because there is another matter I would like your
advice on first It concerns our new product, which is aimed at the European market for
bicycles.
In 2009, we worked on the development of a new type of axle unit. Such a unit is
screwed into a bicycle frame by the bicycle manufacturer It includes an axle and
bearings. The pedals of the bicycle are connected to the ends of the axle via cranks.
This type of axle unit is normally filled with a lubricating composition before it is sealed.
For our axle unit, we developed a special seal (S). This special seal S allows the use of
a larger diameter axle, which is stiffer. This special seal S also allows us to use a new
type of axle of which the diameter decreases towards each end. Unlike the other axles
on the market at the time, the ends of which had square cross-sections, we developed
two new variants of axle ends. The first variant has a pentagonal cross-section. The
second variant has a cross-shaped cross-section. The latter shape is a radical departure
from the normal square shape.
