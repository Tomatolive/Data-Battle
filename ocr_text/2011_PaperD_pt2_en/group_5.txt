EP-PANI and JPIJ-PANI were both filed in the name of Pankutaya Japan KK's Dutch
subsidiary, Pankutaya Nederland B_V_. EP-PANI claims and discloses an axle unit with
a seal exactly the same as the seal S we had developed. The axle decreases in
diameter towards each end. However, the axle of the only embodiment has end sections
with a triangular cross-section. EP-PANI describes the lubricant as a silicone oil with a
further additive that may be a viscosity index improver, an emulsifier or an anti-foamng
agent EP-PANI was assigned to Pankutaya Japan KK after filing.
We were not that surprised by the partial search report, because Pankutaya had already
reported to the standardisation committee in December 2010 the existence of
JPU-PANI, EP-PANI and JPIJ-PAN2. JPU-PAN2 is a second Japanese utility model
application filed on 10 July 2009 and published on 10 October 2009. JPU-PAN2 was
filed directly in the name of Pankutaya Japan K_K_
JPU-PAN2 discloses an axle unit with a seal identical to our seal S and an axle
decreasing in diameter towards each end. The axle has end sections that are
pentagonal in cross-section. The description given in JPIJ-PAN2 states that the axle unit
is filled with a lubricant composition consisting of a silicone oil and one of the following
additives: a viscosity index improver, an emulsifier or an anti-foaming agent We have
established that there are no equivalents to JPIJ-PAN2 in other countries. We have
considered whether to file third palty observations in relation to EP-PANI, citing
JPU-PAN2, but we are not sure whether this is possible.
The standardisation committee has very recently specified the cross-shaped axle end in
a standard, because the members are convinced of its technical advantages over the
pentagonal and the triangular axle ends. For example, other components of the bicycle
that interact with the axle unit can be made lighter.
