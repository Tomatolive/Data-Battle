Both variants of the unit were developed by Alice and Bob, two of our designers, who
were part of our early-stage development team based in Germany. We filed a German
patent application DE-Ax on 30 October 2009, with an independent claim to an axle unit
with the special seal S. Both variants of the axle are fully described. As far as the
lubricating composition is concerned, we included in DE-Ax a long list of different types
of suitable oils, including silicone oil. We indicated that the chosen oil could be combined
with at least one additive, such as an antioxidant, a detergent, a corrosion inhibitor or a
viscosity index improver. All are known components for forming a lubricating
composition. DE-Ax is deemed withdrawn for failure to pay the filing fee.
As we prepared for market introduction, Alice relocated to the United States, to head up
the testing and prototyping of our new axle units. At this stage of the product
development process, she was surprised to discover that a lubricant composition
consisting specifically of a combination of silicone oil and any viscosity index improver
ensures that the special seal S continues to function for longer. Other compositions lead
to leaks of the lubricant past the special seal S at an early stage, thereby limiting the
lifespan of the axle unit For that reason, at the conclusion of the design phase, we had
settled on two variants of our axle unit, each filled with silicone oil and a viscosity index
improver, and including the special seal S and an axle with decreasing diameter towards
axle ends having either a pentagonal or a cross-shaped cross-sectional shape
On 1 February 2010, we submitted detailed specifications of our two axle units as well
as of the preferred lubricant composition to a standardisation committee for bicycle
components. This information was sent on the same day to the members of the
committee for their opinion, prior to a meeting of the committee Most major suppliers to
the bicycle industry are in the committee, which has been set up to ensure that, when
new components are introduced, suppliers of other components have interoperable
components available for consumers and producers of bicycles.
