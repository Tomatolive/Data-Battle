Q9:
No major mistakes were made in answering this question. Maybe the greatest
mistake was to fail to realise that national law determines whether the infringer
could be sued at once or only after the grant of the patent.
The most common error made by the candidates was the lack Of acknowledge-
ment that, contrary to the request for further processing, the payment by cheque
could not be considered as having been made in due time and therefore resulted
in a surcharge of 10%.
QIO: Parts (b) and (c) caused some problems to the candidates.
Part (b): The candidates Often seemed not to have realised that a divisional
application could still be filed if an appeal is pending (the last day for filing the
appeal being 28,03.2001
Part (c): TOO many candidates were not aware Of decisions J36/92 and J27/94
QI 1: Few candidates provided a satisfactory chain of reasoning showing why and
how the time limit for entering the regional phase should validly be calculated
on the basis Of the new priority date Of 15 September 1999. Some candidates
wrongly assumed that the time limit for entering the regional phase had lapsed
and suggested to rely on Rule 85a EPC, resulting in unnecessary payment Of
fees. Very few candidates correctly noted that withdrawal of the priority is valid
because within the 20-month-period (Rule 90bis,3(a)PCT).
