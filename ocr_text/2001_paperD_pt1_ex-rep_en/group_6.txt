Answer to Question 9
The Rule 69(1) EPC communication is deemed to have been delivered on 27.10.2000,
Rule 78(2) EPC; hence the time limit for further processing expired on 27.12.2000.
The letter containing the request for further processing and the response to
communication of the examining division is deemed to have been received in due time
since it was posted 5 days before expiry of the time limit and was sent as registered mail.
Rule 84a EPC and Decision of the President of the EPO dated 1 1 December 1998,
OJ EPO 1999, 45/Guidelines E-Vlll, 1.7).
In the case of the cheque, payment is considered to have been made to the Office on the
date Of receipt Of the cheque, ie 29.12.2000, Article 8(1)(b) RFees, which is after expiry
of the time limit.
Hence the 10% surcharge is due. In accordance with Article 8(4) RFees.
The sum of EUR 76 was not sufficient to pay the fee for further processing; a surcharge
Of 10% on this fee (Article 8(3)(b) RFees) should have been paid.
In accordance with Article 8(4) RFees the EPO may issue a communication requesting
the applicant to provide evidence Of the date on which the second letter was posted and
to pay the surcharge of 10%.
Answer to Question 10
a)
b)
The divisional application is invalid because the loss of rights in respect of the
parent application is deemed to have occurred on expiry of the normal time limit for
filing a request for examination, J 4/86. Thus the parent application is no longer
pending when the divisional application is filed.
Rule 25(1) and Article 94(3) EPC.
Re-establishment Of rights in respect Of the time limit under Article 94(2) EPC is not
possible (Article 122(5) EPC); nor is it possible in respect of the period of grace in
Rule 85b EPC (J 12/82: period Of grace cannot Change the nature Of the basic
period).
Further processing in accordance with Article 121 EPC is also excluded because Of
a Statutory time limit.
To file the divisional application the first application has to be still pending
(Rule 25(1 ) EPC). However, according to Article 106(1) EPC, (Guidelines
A-IV 1.1.4) a divisional can still be filed during the appeal procedure.
The time limit for filing the appeal expired today, 28.03.2001. File the notice
Of appeal per fax and pay the appeal fee today.
The appeal on the first application can be abandoned after having filed the
divisional application.
