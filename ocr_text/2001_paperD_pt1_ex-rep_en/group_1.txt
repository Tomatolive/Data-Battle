This question was generally well answered. Some candidates omitted to
provide sufficient legal basis for supporting their justification (eg by citing
(33/89 and/or GI 1/91).
The mention of filing the request for apportionment of costs during oral
proceedings, before a decision, was very Often overlooked by candidates.
Moreover, the fact that the opponent informed at the last moment that he
would not attend the oral proceedings was rarely regarded as a possible
abuse of procedure. Many candidates failed to distinguish between request
for fixing Of costs and request for apportionment Of costs.
This question was generally well answered but most candidates neglected to
mention that sending copy of the article to the Examining Division would be
appropriate for proving that the abstract is erroneous.
The majority of candidates missed out that sufficient evidence of personal interest
in proceedings should be required. Many candidates failed to realise that the
objection should be raised asap, before taking any further procedural steps.
The candidates encountered no major difficulties with this question. Some of
them surprisingly wrongly fixed the time limit Of 31 December 2000 instead Of
31 December 2001. Their opinion was founded on the false belief that the last
payment made in 1995 caused lapse of the patent at the end of 1995. Some
others correctly cited the provisions of Rule EPC but failed in applying
them to the specific case, ending with a wrong date (typically March 2001).
This question raised no major problems to the candidates.
Inappropriate recommendations to the client to use Article 121 and/or
Article 122 EPC caused the candidates to lose marks. In part (a) some
candidates failed to point out that a missing inventors address is regarded as
a minor deficiency according to the Guidelines A-III, 5.5. This mistake resulted
in wrong conclusions about both legal consequences and legal remedies.
Regarding part (c) numerous candidates failed to acknowledge that in the
case of an intemational application the time period was set by the EPO and
is therefore extendable under Rule 84 EPC.
