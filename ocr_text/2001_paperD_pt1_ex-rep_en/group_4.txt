Answer to Question 7
a)
b)
Designation Of inventor (Article 81 EPC) is validly filed, but contains a minor
deficiency (incomplete address = formal deficiency; Rule 17(1) EPC). The period
for correcting the deficiency is therefore set by the EPO (Article 91 (2) EPC;
minimum period of two months; Rule 84, first sentence, EPC). Rule 84 EPC
period set by the EPO, not yet expired. Extension Of period on request.
Legal consequence = refusal of application Article 91 first sentence, EPC.
Legal remedies: Further processing: Article 121 EPC ( time limit set by the EPO
and total loss of rights). Re-establishment of rights: Article 122 EPC.
(Guidelines A-III, 5.5).
Designation Of inventor (Article 81 EPC) is not validly filed. The following are
required: name and address Of inventor, statement Of origin Of the right to the patent
and signature of applicant (Rule 17(1) EPC, Guidelines A-III, 5.5). Lack of signature
of applicant is a major deficiency â€” designation of inventor is deemed not to have
been filed. Notification in accordance with Article 91(1)(f) and (5) in conjunction with
Rule 42(1) EPC. Corrected designation to be filed within 16 months of priority date
(z 27 November 1999), ie by 27 March 2001 or
within a period of 2 months whichever is the longest (Guidelines A-III, 5.5).
Time limit of two months should thus be granted by the EPO. Time limit expired
on 1 April 2001 , extended to 2 April 2001.
