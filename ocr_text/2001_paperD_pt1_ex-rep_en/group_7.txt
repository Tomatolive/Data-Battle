c)
The divisional application has been validly filed. Where an applicant approves the
text of a European patent application pursuant to Rule 51 (4) EPC and in the same
letter states that he had that day filed a divisional application, the filing of the
divisional should be allowed, whether or not it is actually received by the EPO
on the same day as the letter. (See J 36/92 and J 27/94).
Answer to Question 11
Yes. The time limit for entering the regional phase expires 21 or 31 months as from the
first priority date (Rule 107(1) EPC), depending on whether or not a demand has been
filed prior to the expiration of the 19th month from the priority date (Article 39 PCT).
In the present case, the 19-month period expired on 10.01.2001. Withdrawal Of the
1st priority on 19.01.2001 did not affect this time limit, as it had already expired
(Rule 90bis.3(d) PCT).
For the priority however, the withdrawal is valid, since it was done prior to the expiration
Of 20 months from the priority date (Rule 90bis.3(a) PCT).
The entry into the regional phase by 21 -month period as calculated from the 1 st priority
date only expired on 10.03.2001, i.e. after the withdrawal.
Hence, in accordance with Rule 90bis.3(d) PCT. the 21 -month limit under Article 22 PCT
now runs from the new priority date, namely 15.09.99 (Article 2(xi) PCT) and expires on
15.06.2001.
The regional phase can thus still validly be entered by taking the Steps according to Rule
107(1) PCT.
