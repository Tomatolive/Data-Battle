Description of Client's Patent Application
[001] The invention relates to closures that are used to seal bottles.
[002] Dl describes a prior art closure connected by thermal welding to a bottle.
A projection is folded back on top of the main pan of the closure. The projection forms a
pull-tab for removing the closure from the bottle. The pull-tab can break away from the
main part of the closure during mounting or removal of a screw cap so that the pull-tab is
no longer available for removing the closure from the bottle.
[003] The invention is defined in the claims.
[004] FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a first embodiment of a closure 10 that covers an opening 42 of
a bottle 40. The closure 10 includes a tab part 12 and a sealing part 20. A first portion of
the tab part 12 is firmly attached to the sealing pan 20. A second portion of the
tab part is lightly attached to the sealing part (FIG. 2). The second poltion of the
tab pan 12 can be released to form a pull-tab 18 (FIGS. 1 and 3). The pull-tab 18 can be
gripped to remove the closure 10 from the bottle 40. FIG. 2 also shows a screw cap 46
that is screwed onto the bottle 40 and covers the closure 10.
[005] In the first embodiment, the sealing part 20 of the closure is formed from a
laminated sheet comprising a polyester film 22 and a metal foil 24, for example an
aluminium foil. The metal foil 24 seals the product in the bottle 40. The polyester film 22
prevents the metal foil 24 from tearing as the closure 10 is removed from the bottle.
