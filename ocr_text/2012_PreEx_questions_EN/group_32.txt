Claim analysis
For the purposes of question 19, assume that:
- D2 is the closest prior art, it being acknowledged that D2 discloses a closure
comprising features corresponding to those of the precharacterising part of claim IX;
- the objective technical problem is defined as being to improve the resistance to
separation of the pull tab from the sealing part during application of a screw cap.
For each of the statements 19.1 â€” 19.4, indicate by marking true or false on the answer
sheet whether the statement is a valid argument why it is not obvious to solve the stated
objective technical problem by the features of claim 1k
The subject matter of claim IX involves an inventive step because
19.1
D2 discloses a closure with a joined portion where a polyester film is attached
to an aluminium foil, and a separated portion, forming a pull-tab, where the
polyester film is separate and free from the aluminium foil.
19.2
D2 discloses that where a pull-tab is to be lightly attached to the sealing part,
this should be achieved by a strip of adhesive.
19.3
the cited an does not disclose or suggest using a discontinuous adhesive
portion distributed over the portion of the sealing part to which a pull-tab is
attached, for lightly attaching the pull-tab to the sealing part.
194
the cited an does not disclose or suggest using dots of adhesive to lightly
attach a pull-tab to a sealing pan.
