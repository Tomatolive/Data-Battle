[001] A closure 1 is adapted for securing to and closing an opening of a bottle.
[002] FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a first embodiment of the closure 1 mounted on the neck of a
bottle 11. FIG. 1 is a perspective view ofthe closure 1 on the bottle 11. FIG. 2 is a
cross-sectional view of the closure on the neck of the bottle. A screw cap 10 covers the
closure 1. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a method of opening the bottle.
[003] The closure 1 includes a laminated sealing part 2 comprising a metal foil 3, for
example an aluminium foil, and a plastics foil 4. A lower sulface of the plastics foil 4 is
coated with a thermoweldable material 5, which melts on heating, for example as a
result of induction heating of the metal foil, to enable the closure to be attached to the
neck of the bottle 1 1
[004] The closure 1 further includes a polyester film 6. Between the polyester film 6 and
the metal foil 3 is a layer of adhesive T The layer of adhesive 7 extends over up to half
of the closure 1 and firmly attaches that portion of the polyester film 6 to the
sealing part 2 The remainder of the polyester film 6 is not attached to the sealing part 2
and forms a pull-tab 9. The closure 1 thus includes a joned portion 8 where the
polyester film 6 is attached to the sealing part 2, and a separated portion, forming the
pull-tab 9, where the polyester film 6 is not attached to the sealing pan 2.
[005] As shown in FIG. 3, in order to open the bottle 11, the screw cap 10 is removed in
the direction of the arrow 12 This reveals the closure 1 attached to the bottle 11. The
closure 1 can then be removed by grasping the free-standing pull-tab g and pulling in the
direction of the arrow 13. The joined portion 8 of the closure 1 can be pulled from the
neck of the bottle 1 1, followed by detachment of the separated portion of the closure 1
The relative bond strength of the layer of adhesive 7 and that of the
thermoweldable material 5 are such that the closure 1 is removable as a unit
