Claim analysis
For the purposes of question 20, assume that:
- D2 is the closest prior art, it being acknowledged that D2 discloses a closure
comprising features corresponding to those of the precharacterising portion of claim X;
- the objective technical problem is defined as being to improve the resistance to
separation of the pull tab from the sealing part during application of a screw cap.
For each of the statements 20.1 â€” 204, indicate by marking true or false on the answer
sheet whether the statement is a valid argument why it is not obvious to solve the stated
objective technical problem by the features of claim X.
The subject matter of claim X involves an inventive step because
20.1

to an aluminium foil, and a separated portion, forming a pull-tab, where the
polyester film is separate and free from the aluminium foil.
20.2
D2 discloses that where a pull-tab is to be lightly attached to the sealing part,
this should be achieved by a strip of adhesive.
20.3
