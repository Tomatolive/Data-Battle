Claim analysis
[006] A thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the
polyester film 22. The thermoweldable material 26 is a material that softens on being
heated and can be used to weld the closure 10 to the top of the bottle 40. The
thermoweldable material 26 can be softened by heating (e. g. by inductively heating) the
metal foil 24.
[007] The tab part 12 is formed by a polyester film. The tab pan 12 is attached to the
metal foil 24 of the sealing part 20 (the upper surface of the sealing pan 20) by an
adhesive layer 32. The adhesive layer 32 includes a continuous adhesive portion 34,
and a discontinuous adhesive portion which is preferably formed by two or more
adhesive dots 36.
[008] The continuous adhesive portion 34 completely covers a first portion of the upper
surface of the sealing part 20 (forming up to half of the area), and permanently attaches
the first portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The discontinuous adhesive
portion provides an incomplete layer of adhesive. Preferably the discontinuous adhesive
portion is distributed over the remainder of the upper surface of the sealing pan 20.
[009] The size of the adhesive dots 36 determines the degree of adhesion of the second
portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The degree of adhesion is determined
so as to prevent separation of the second portion of the tab part 12 from the
sealing part 20 during attachment of the screw cap 46, but to enable a user to peel the
second portion of the tab pan 12 away from the sealing part 20 to form the pull-tab 18
[010] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the top of the bottle 40 with the
closure 10 covering the opening 42 of the bottle and the screw cap 46 covering the
closure 10.
