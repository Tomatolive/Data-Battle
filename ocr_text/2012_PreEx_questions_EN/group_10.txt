and independent claim 2 directed to a process. The two claims are not linked by a single

statement is true or false.
8.1
82
8.3
A notice of opposition must be filed at the latest by 22 March 2012
If an opposition is filed against claim 1 only, the opposition can be extended by
the opponent to claim 2 after the expiry of the opposition period.
The statement setting out the grounds for opposition must be filed at the latest by
22 May 2012.

unity of the invention is a valid ground for opposition.
