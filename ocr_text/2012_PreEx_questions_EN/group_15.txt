Claim analysis
[011] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a method of opening the bottle 40.
Firstly, the screw cap 46 is removed in the direction of the arrow 44. The pull-tab 18 is
then peeled away from the sealing part 20. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled in the direction
of the arrow 48 to cause the thermal weld of the sealing pan 20 to the bottle 40 to break
under the continuous adhesive portion 34. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled further in the
direction of the arrow 48 until the closure 10 is removed from the bottle 40.
[012] FIG. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of a closure 50 comprising a
sealing part 20 configured to provide evidence of tampering on removing the closure by
pulling the pull-tab 18. The sealing part 20 of the second embodiment only comprises
the metal foil 24. The thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the
metal foil 24 in the second embodiment The second embodiment is othemise
constructed in the same manner as the first embodiment The second embodiment of
the closure functions and is removed in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment
of the closure 10 illustrated in FIGS 1-3 However, without the polyester film 22, the
metal foil 24 tears as the closure 50 is removed from the bottle 40. A tear in the
metal foil 24 therefore provides evidence of tampering in the second embodiment.
