Claim analysis
[006] FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a closure 21 _ The closure 21 is the
same as the closure 1 except that an additional thin strip of adhesive 27 is provided to
lightly attach the pull-tab g to the sealing part 2 to avoid damage to the pull-tab before it
is used. The pull-tab g can be released by breaking the light attachment provided by the
thin strip of adhesive 21 However, care is needed during manufacture to ensure that the
attachment provided by the strip of adhesive 27 is not so strong that it prevents release
of the pull-tab g.
