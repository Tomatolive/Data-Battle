Assume for this question that claim VIII is formulated in the two-pan form with respect to
D2 as the closest prior art and that the technical effect of the characterising portion is
that the aluminium foil tears on removing the closure. For each of the
statements 181 â€” 18.4, indicate by marking true or false on the answer sheet whether
the statement is a valid definition of the objective technical problem with respect to D2
based on this technical effect.
The objective technical problem with respect to D2 is to
