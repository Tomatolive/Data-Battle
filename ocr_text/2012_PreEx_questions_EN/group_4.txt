Mr X can validly claim priority if he files the European patent application on
10 April 2012.
The priority declaration must be made at the latest on 10 August 2012.
If Mr X had filed a German utility model application instead of a German patent
application, it would have been possible to claim priority from the German utility
model application.
Mr X can claim priority from the German patent application even if the German
patent application is abandoned before filing of the European patent application.
