Answer to Question 7
According to Rule 81 (1) EPC, if a representative has been appointed, notification Shall
be addressed to him. A representative has been appointed on 23.11.1999 which is
before the date of the written decision of 03.12.1999.
If, despite the appointment Of a representative, notification is made directly to the
opponent himself, the notification is ineffective (T 703/92).
According to Rule 82 EPC, a document shall be deemed to have been notified on the
date established by the EPO as date Of receipt.
In this case, the representative has received the decision On 03.032000. Therefore
due date for filing appeal is 03.05.2000 in accordance with Art. 108 EPC. Appeal is
still possible.
