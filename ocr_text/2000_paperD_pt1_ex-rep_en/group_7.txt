Answer to Question 11
The three month deadline had expired on 20 March 2000.
The international preliminary examination repott must be established by 16 June 2000,
28 months from priority according to Rule 69.2 PCT.
According to Rule 66.4bis PCT the IPEA need not take into account any arguments or
amendments submitted after it has begun to draw up the report.
If the examiner has begun to draw up the report, the arguments and amendments can
only be submitted on Or after entering the regional phase.
Contact the examiner to request a personal interview pursuant to Rule 66.6 PCT and he
must grant this provided he has not begun to draw up the report.
Failure to respond does not lead to loss of the application, only that the IPER will include
unfavourable comments.
