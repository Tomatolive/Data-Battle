Answer to Question 8
a) The article might be introduced into the examining procedure by filing observations
in accordance with Article 115 (1) EPC.
Since the article was published between the priority date and the filing date, the
examining division will check whether the priority claim is valid (C-V, 2.1), and will
set a time limit in accordance with Rule 38 (4) EPC within which the translation Of
the previous application must be filed.
A declaration stating identity of the texts of the EP and the JP application cannot
be accepted since the EP application contains more text than the JP application.
Under these circumstances, the translation will be available by inspection Of the files,
Art. 128 (4) EPC, at a date which is earlier than the normal time limit under
Rule 51 (6) EPC.
b) This is not the best solution from a tactical point of view since the applicant is warned
to file the translation of the priority document and then to amend the claims in such a
way that the priority claim becomes valid. Hence, it is more recommendable to wait,
or to instruct a JP patent attorney to compare the JP application to the article, Or
Other acceptable alternatives like no action at all, national procedure, opposition
procedure, family search.
Answer to Question 9
The patent will not be maintained as granted.
Claim 1 as granted extends beyond the content Of the application as filed in the sense
Of Article 123 (2) EPC, and therefore, the ground for opposition under Article 100 c) EPC
prejudices maintenance Of the patent.
Removal Of the added feature is not possible since extend√â1g the protection conferred,
thus offending against Article 123 (3) EPC.
Hence the patentee is caught in a trap between Article 123 (2) and Article 123 (3) EPC.
The conditions outlined in G 1/93 under which he could maintain or replace the added
feature do not apply in the present case.
Answer to Question 10
The error cannot be corrected before the EPO.
Art. 70 (1) EPC states that the text Of a European patent in the language Of the proceed-
ings, i.e. English in the present case, shall be the authentic text.
The translations are not part Of the decision to grant (Art. 97 (2) EPC), nor are they
examined (Guidelines C-VI, 15.2.1). Hence Rule 89 EPC being applicable to decisions
of the EPO cannot be applied to the translations of the claims.
Rule 88 EPC does not apply after publication Of the grant in the Patent Bulletin.
