Question 11
Not many candidates have correctly assessed that the report must be established by
16 June 2000. Thus, it is likely that the examiner has not yet drawn up the report. They
failed to address the most simple suggestion, ie to contact the examiner, eg for an interview
under Rule 66.6 PCT, to then file amendments as requested by the applicant. It is worth
mentioning in this respect, that a positive IPER can speed up the subsequent procedure,
at least before the EPO
Few candidates have clearly answered that failure to respond to a written opinion in
PCT II procedures does not lead to any loss of the application.
Model Solution for Paper D, Part I
Answer to Question 1
According to new Rule 94.3 PCT. an elected Office may allow inspection Of the files
Of a published international application according to its national/regional law.
The EPO will allow inspection Of the files Of international applications filed on or after
01. July 1998, in accordance with the provisions Of Article 128 (4) EPC, as established
in the notice published in EPO OJ 1999/329, see also the EPO Guidelines E-IX, 6.5.
Answer to Question 2
The patent will not be revoked by the EPO.
Pursuant to G8/93 (OJ 1994, 887), as soon as an opponent who is sole appellant
withdraws his opposition, the appeal proceedings are automatically terminated.
The board Of appeal no longer has the power to examine the substantive merits of the
case under the terms Of Article 114 EPC, as for that purpose the proceedings must be
pending.
There is however a risk that the patent will be declared null and void in national
proceedings.
Answer to Question 3
The Spanish attorney can file the application according to Art. 75 (1) EPC with the
Spanish patent office, or any other competent authority of any contracting state which
so permits and with the EPO.
In all cases the application must be filed in an EPO official language as Art. 14(2) EPC
does not apply, because the applicant is not resident of one of the contracting states.
If the application is filed with the Spanish patent office, a Spanish translation must be
annexed. If he filed with any other competent authority a translation may be required.
(See "National Law relating to the EPC", Ch. II).
