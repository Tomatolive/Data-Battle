Question 8
Most candidates did mention the possibility Of filing the observations under
Art. 115(1) EPC for introducing the article into the proceedings. Not all Of them clearly
stated that the examining division actually will check whether the priority claimed is valid,
because the article has been published in the priority interval, and the application
contains more text than the priority application (Guidelines C-V, 2.1), and thus will set
a time limit for filing the translation of the priority application. â€” Very few suggested
searching for corresponding national applications, Or instructing a JP patent attorney
to compare application and article.
Question 9
Almost all of the candidates acknowledged that the requirements of Art. 123(2) EPC had
been contravened and that the ground of opposition under Att. IOO(c) EPC was justified.
Many mentioned the impossibility Of deleting the restriction without extending the scope
Of protection under Art. 123(3) EPC. Very few have correctly discussed G 1/93, as to
whether and when the criteria for maintaining or replacing the added restriction are
fulfilled. The majority however concluded that the patent will be revoked. Actually this
conclusion is not strictly correct. The fact that the proprietor cannot maintain the patent
as granted, in particular claim 1 , does not amount to the patent being revoked (in its
entirety). Actually, the proprietor might be able to fall back to an allowable claim without
the non-admissible restriction. Very few answered the question fully and correctly.
Question 10
Before commenting on the answers, it is worth stressing that the question was Whether
the error (missing claim in the French translation) could be corrected before the EPO
(not before any national instance) in the situation as delineated. Actually, not many
acknowledged that and explained why the error cannot be corrected before the EPO.
First Of all, the error did not result from the publication Of the specification Of the patent by
the EPO (ie no printing error). The error was already present when the French translation
of the claims was filed by the applicant.
A high number of candidates Were not aware that the translation Of the claims in the two
other languages actually is not part Of the decision to grant.
Although the question did mention that no opposition had been filed (and the day Of the
examination was well after the nine month period of AN. 99 EPC), hence neither opposi-
tion, nor opposition-appeal proceedings were running, many nevertheless suggested
correction under Rule 88 EPC, first or second sentence. They were actually not aware
that for Rule 88 EPC to be applicable (implementation of Art. 123(2) EPC) proceedings
before the EPO must be running (Guidelines, C-VI, 5.9).
Several wrongly relied on legal certainty for the public (missing claim) to justify the
correction of the error by a new publication of the specification by the EPO.
Some candidates correctly acknowledged that the text in the language Of the proceed-
ings is the authentic text (see Art. 70(1) EPC), and this text was complete and correct.
Many Of these did not use the information correctly.
