Question 4
This question was well answered apart the fact that some candidates did not mention
that the International search report takes the place Of the European search report.
Question 5
Some candidates correctly mentioned the relevant legal provisions, they actually failed to
apply them to the case in question, ie by explicitly stating that in the case in question the
divisional application should be filed at the latest with the filing of the amendments.
Question 6
A number Of candidates were not aware Of T 382/94 and have either erroneously referred
to the legal provisions Of Rule 43 EPC and to the Guidelines A-II, 4.7 and A-III, 10, ie
redating Of the application. These legal provisions actually apply to late-filed or missing
drawings, whereas in the present case the drawings were present ab initio, albeit with
text in another language, ie with non-complying physical requirements. Some candidates
even generically affirmed that Art. 80(d) EPC does not require the filing Of drawings for
according the filing date, thus ignoring the fact that in the Case in question the drawings
were part (ie accompanied and were cited in the description) of the application as filed.
Question 7
Surprisingly this basic question was badly answered by many, Who actually missed the
only means of redress, with the consequence of a serious loss of right of appeal for the
opponent. This denotes lack Of knowledge Of the provisions on notification (Rules 81
and 82 EPC) as well as of the relevant case law (eg T 703/92).
Many simply asserted that appeal was not possible any longer, because the time limit
under Art. 108 EPC had lapsed on 03.02.2000 (without any account Of the ten days
Rule), or on 14.02.2000 (account Of the ten days rule as well as Of Rule 85(1) EPC),
without any doubt as to the ineffectiveness Of the notification.
A number mentioned restitutio (actually this means Of redress is not applicable to the
notice Of appeal, as decided in T 210/89 and G 1/86), because the cause Of non-
compliance was in the non valid notification according to Rule 81(1) EPC, which non-
compliance actually was removed only on 03.03.2000.
Some candidates confused closure Of oral proceedings with closure Of written proceed-
ings, ie the actual despatch Of the written decision. They argued that in oral proceedings
the pronouncement Of the decision closes the proceedings, thus the appointment Of the
representative after the 1 1.11.1999 was not valid or late filed. Thus, the time limit under
Art. 108 EPC had lapsed and no errors in the notification Of the decision by the EPO
could be seen either.
Several, in view Of the ineffective notification, wrongly suggested writing to the EPO to
request a new notification of the decision, upon which the time limit for appeal should
run anew.
