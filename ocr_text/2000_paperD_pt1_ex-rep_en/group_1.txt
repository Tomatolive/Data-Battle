Examiners' Report on Paper D
PART 1 - General
Some questions, in particular questions 7 to 11 , at least in part, caused difficulty for many
candidates. The other questions were substantially or sufficiently (well) answered by the
majority Of the candidates. It is worth repeating that in part I the candidates are expected
to quickly and correctly apply their legal knowledge to the facts as given. Reasons and
legal basis justifying and explaining how the said application of legal knowledge fits to the
said facts should be given to get full points. The questions should be read carefully,
because the answers should be to the point. Comments are given below on the aspects/
questions which were found difficult.
Question 1
This question was open as to date Of filing of the international application and place Of
inspection, and this openness gave sufficient freedom Of answer to the Candidates, ie yes
or no, but with appropriate arguments. A number Of candidates answered the question in
an exhaustive manner however.
Actually, the candidates were expected to be familiar with new Rule 94 PCT. as in force
from 01.07.1998 for applications filed on or after that date. As a matter Of fact, new
Rule 94.3 PCT does mention the term •third parties• Of the question. Many (also or only)
cited Rule 94.1 PCT. This Rule does not fit to the question as given, because a prelimi-
nary examination report is being carried out before the EPO.
Question 2
Most candidates, albeit they correctly acknowledged that the patent will not be revoked
by the Board of appeal of the EPO pursuant to G 8/93, however failed to explain that
proceedings must be pending for the purpose of examination under Art. 114(1) EPC,
which is not the case here Once opposition has been withdrawn.
Very few mentioned that, in view of the new novelty destroying document, the patent
actually might be attacked on nullity before the national instances.
Question 3
Some candidates actually held that the representative could nevertheless file the
application in Spanish before the Spanish Patent Office, ig10ring the fact that the
applicant (an Argentinean company) does not fulfill the requirements of Art. 14(2) EPC,
and that these legal provisions apply to the applicants and not to the representatives
(see T 149/85). Many overlooked the necessity for filing a translation in Spanish, if the
representative filed the application in any EPO Official language (DE, EN, FR) before the
Spanish Patent Office. Most realized the possibility of filing the application at the EPO,
but many overlooked the possbility Of filing at national Offices Other than the Spanish
Patent Office.
