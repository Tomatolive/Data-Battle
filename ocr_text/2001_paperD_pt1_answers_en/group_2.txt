It is possible to inspect the file at the EPO under A. 128(4) following publication under
A. 93. Since the patent has been granted it must have been published.
According to R. the files will be kept for at least five years from the end
of the year in which the patent lapses in the last of the designated states.
When renewal fees become due depends on the states in which it was validated, but
in almost all countries this is the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the
date of filing (NatLaw, Table VI). so unless GB was last to lapse, the next ones will all
have been due 31.3.96 but not paid, so the patents all lapsed 31.3,96.
Five years from then is 31.3.01 (Saturday) so this time limit is extended under R. 85(1)
to 2.4.01 which is the last day the file can be inspected.
If a patent granted on a divisional is still in force, the file of the patent will be kept
at least as long as that of thc divisional (R. 95a(5)) — so for another 5 years after the
divisional is abandoned or lapses.
Application was filed after the cut-off date Of I. 7.99 so only 7 designation fees
are payable (RFees 2(3)). Since 2 unnecessary designation fees have been paid, 2 will
be refunded (GLX A-I O).
One designation fee will be refunded as CH and LI are a single designation (A. 142(1)).
The designation fees were validly paid so there is no reason for them to be refunded.
There is no legal basis for payment Of designation fees as there is no pending
application for the fees to be paid on. So they will all be refunded
(GLX A-Xl, 10.1.10)).
The designation of inventor must include the inventor's address (R. 17(1)).
The Communication informing us of this deficiency will have been issued under
R. 42(1 ) warning us that the application will be deemed to be withdrawn (A. 91 (5))
if a complete designation is not filed.
The notification will have been deemed received on 25.2.01 (R. 78(2)). 2 months from
then is 25.4.01. So can still bc validly filed.
However, L 19/99 & GLX A-III, 5.5 state that the complete designation can be filed the
late of two months from this notification or 16 months from priority — so it is possible
1 6 months expires later (we don 't know priority date).
Two month limit under R. 42(1) is an office time limit leading to deemed withdrawal if
not met. So further processing (A. 121) is possible — within two months of notification
of deemed withdrawal, file des. Of inventorship with address & pay further processing
Restitutio under A. 122 is also possible — within I year of missed time limit (& within
2 months of notification of deemed withdrawal — J 27/94), pay restitutio fee, file notice
& grounds & provide evidence that all due care was taken in the circumstances.
