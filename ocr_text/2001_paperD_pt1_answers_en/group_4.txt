Priority date is 2.00
So publication expected (in French) in 8.01 (A. 930)). We need to get application published
as soon as possible — this can be done immediately providing filing and search fees were paid
(A-VI, I. l) & since they were due in March 2000 (A. 78(2)) & we are told all fees were paid,
this is the case.
Once application is published then under A. 67(1) it confers same protection as granted
patent (A. 64) in each designated State.
This may well extend only to damages recoverable after grant & not the ability to bring
action before grant (A. 67(2)). It is also necessary in all states to file a translation of the
claims in a language of that state to obtain provisional protection (A. 67(3)) — all states
require this. Some states also require that the claims translations are forwarded to the
potential infringer.
We also need to request accelerated processing to get the patent granted as quickly as
possible (PACE — Notice of President dated I ,7.97).
SO need to
request accelerated search (although search report should have already issued within
6 months Of filing)
request accelerated examination
submit exam request & pay exam fee (A. 94(2)) now.
pay designation fees (A. 79(2)) now for states in which competitor is infringing.
If patent is accepted for grant, can request accelerated grant under A. 97(6) — reply to
R. 5 1 (4) communication immediately & request early publication of grant. Must also pay
grant & printing fees (A. 97(4)) and claims translations into English & German (A. 97(5)) as
early as possible.
Also note that all outstanding renewal fees must be paid before publication of grant —
first renewal fee (for 3rd year) is not due until 28-2.02 (R. 37(1)) however.
R. 69(1) EPC communication deemed received 27.10.00 (R. 78(2)).
Further processing must be requested within 2 months (A. 121(2)), i.e. by 27.12.00
(Wednesday).
Registered letter containing request for further processing & response was despatched 5 days
before deadline and received within 3 months Of deadline. This will therefore have been
deemed received in time to meet the deadline (R. 84a(l) EPC, Dec. of Pres. dated 11.12.98)
since it was sent by registered post. So request & response deemed received in time.
However, the cheque (EUR 76 correct. RFees 2.12) was sent separately and R. 84a does not
apply to payment of fees (OJ 1999, 301 22-32).
But under RFees 8(3), if a fee is paid late it shall be considered paid in time if a cheque and
letter were despatched at a post office, bearing the address of the EPO, before the deadline
(RFees 8(3)(a)(iii)). Evidence may be needed (RFees 8(4)) that the cheque was indeed sent
then (eg registered post receipt).
