Candidate's Answer — DI
EPI is filed in Italian, which is acceptable for an Italian applicant (A. 14(2) EPC).
Translation was filed within 2 weeks, well within the deadline under R. 6(1).
The authentic text of the application is the English translation (A. 70(1)). However this
can be corrected under R. 88 with no danger Of adding matter (A. 123(2)) because under
A. 70(2) the original (Italian) text constitutes the basis for detennining whether matter is
added. So it is possible to correct for EPI .
EP2 was filed in English. The application as filed is therefore this English text. It might be
possible to correct the translation under R. 88 but only if the correction is obvious in the
sense that it is immediately evident the English text that nothing else would have been
intended than what is offered as the correction. The Italian priority document cannot be used
to show what was intended (G 3/89).
Ask for an apportionment of costs (A. 104(1 during oral proceedings. The apportionment
will form part of the decision on the opposition (GLX D-lX, 1.2, R. 63(1 )). After the decision
a request for the awarding of costs must be filed within a month in writing to the EPO
(R. 63(3)) to get the amount — the month runs from the date of notification which will be
deemed received 1 days after receipt (R. 78(2)).
Costs incurred when the Other party withdraws just before oral proceedings will generally be
apportioned (D-lX, I A).
I would point Out that although both the document & abstract theoretically form part of the
state of the art under A. 54(2), following T 77/87 an original and its abstract cannot disclose
different subject matter as a matter of technical reality and when there is an inconsistency the
original document must permit, so it must be presumed the skilled person would disregard
the abstract which therefore does form part of the state of the art under A. 54. The prior
published document must stand prima facie on its own & complete (T 77/87). However I
would also attempt to provide evidence as to the incorrectness of the abstract (T 160/92).
We can make an objection to the inclusion of the member ofthe opposition division.
Unfortunately the EPC has no provisions for exclusion from a member of a department of
ISt instance because of suspected partiality, but does have such provisions for members of
Boards Of Appeal (A. 24(1)). However, the basic requirement Of impartiality does apply to
departments Of I instance as well (G 5/91). so we can raise the objection. If it is refused,
the decision to ignore the rejection cannot be appealed separately but may be challenged in
a final appeal (A. 106(1)). It is also possible that the Opposition Division will decide on the
objection by means of an appealable interlocutory decision (G 5/91).
Any appeal fee may be refunded (R. 67) if the appeal is successful because partiality of
a member Of the opposition division constitutes a substantial procedural violation (T 433/93).
