11.
First priority date was 10.6.99
Deadline for demand (A. PCT) was thus 19 months later i.e. 10.1.01 in order to put
the application into Chapter II. Priorities can be withdrawn (R. 90bis 3(a)(b)), and this means
that all time limits are calculated from the next earlier date of priority (R. 90bis 3(c)) but
only time limits not already expired. Since the demand deadline was already past by the time
the I priority was withdrawn the application did not enter Chapter II then & the
international phase expired after 20 months (A. 22 PCT) — i.e.
But this the withdrawal of the priority, so the 20 months of A. 22 PCT is now
computed from the other priority which is 15,9.99. This 20 month deadline is thus 15.5.01.
To enter national phase before EPO, 21 month deadline applies (A. 22(3) PCT,
R. 107(1) EPC), so it is still possible.
SO by 15.6-01 must
—file request for entry into regional phase (R. 107 EPC)
— indicate documents to be used for grant procedure (R. EPC)
—pay national, search & claims fees (R. R. 110(1) EPC)
—pay exam + designation fees (R. EPC)
3rd year renewal fee will be due (R. 37) on 30.6.02.
Note exam + designation fees would have already fallen due since publication would have
been 10.12.00 so deadline would have been —
-6-
