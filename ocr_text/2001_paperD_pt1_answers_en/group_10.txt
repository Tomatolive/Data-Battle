NF-EUI and therefore should still be patentable. This would cover part ofthe process
of manufacturing X as a woven textile as described above and would therefore allow
Niffy to prevent you supplying X as a woven textile to F in whichever states NF-EU I
is granted in.
Since you are, at the very least, going to be able to get some forrn of valid patent to
blottane or to its use as a moisture-absorbent, even if it involves post-grant amendments, it
would seem that some form of cross-licensing would be in order with Niffy. None of your
other contacts make shoes, and it sounds as though product X would be better for shoes
than other blottanes because of its odour-absorbing properties. Niffy may therefore wish
to use X in their shoes â€” and anyway will require a license to use any blottane as a
moisture absorbent. You are going to need a license from them (probably) to make long
fibres of X, and also (possibly, depending on what happens to NF-EU2) to LLse blottanes
in general or to use blottanes as a moisture absorbent. So you will need to Come to an
agreement with them.
