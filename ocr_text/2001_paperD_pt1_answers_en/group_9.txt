claims to disposable nappies containing product X. This is based on the fact that B-EU2
cannot have matter added to it extending beyond the content of B-EU2 as filed
(Art. 123(2)). So claims to product X can also not be introduced into B-EU2. Art. 123(2)
(matter compared to application as filed) and Alt. I ) (matter compared to patent) are
quite separate restrictions (T 441/92).
A divisional can also theoretically not be filed based on B-EUI as approval Ofthe text
under R. 5 1 (4) has already been given (R. 25(1 j). The only chance of filing a divisional
based on B-EUI is if examination proceeding are re-opened before the decision to grant
is issued, as discussed under Point 2, p. 8 • above. Following G 7/93 approval of the text
becomes binding only on the issue of the decision to grant.
However, it is not possible to withdraw approval of the text simply to file a divisional
(J 29/96). If you file an amendment and the EPO simply accepts it and issues the decision
to grant, then it will still not be possible to file a divisional, as this is still deemed approval
Of the text (J 29/95). Only hope is for FPO to re-open examination proceedings, in which
case R. 51(4) will require a new approval of the text, in which case a divisional can be
filed up until the new approval ofthe text (G 10/92).
The best bet would seem to be to attempt to file amended claims on B-EUI including
a claim to a disposable nappy containing X and a claim to the use of blottanes as a
moisture absorbent, drawing the examiner's attention to NF-EU2 and arguing that
exceptional circumstances apply (T 92/85) so examination should be re-opened. Then
he might re-open examination, in which case divisional can be validly filed. Or he might
(R. 86(3)) simply accept the amendment, in which case no divisional can be filed but at
least B•EUI would contain a claim to a disposable nappy containing X. Or he might just
refuse the amendment and issue the decision to grant, in which case we have not lost
anything by tDing! It is important only to amendment, not withdraw approval
of text under R. 5 1 (4), as Otherwise you lun the risk of the application being refused for
lack of an agreed text (R. 51(5)).
As ever. this depends on whether the designation fees for NF-EU2 are paid.
Ifthe designation fees for NF-EU2 paid with surcharge in the period of grace under
R. 85a(l) or R. 85a(2), then claims in NF-EUI to the process of producing continuous
fibres, and to blottanes in the form Of a woven textile, would not be valid as they would
be anticipated under Art. 54(3) by NF-EU2. So they could not use NE-EUI to stop you.
HQY.gygr, if they also paid the examination fees on NF-EU2 with surcharge within the
R. 85b grace period, then NF-EU2 would remain alive and might proceed to grant. It
contains a claim to a process for making continuous fibres of blottanes, and such a claim
would prevent you from making continuous fibres of X (which is a blottane). It would
also (Art. 64(2)) protect the continuous fibres of X per se. as the direct product of the
claimed process. They could thus stop you from producing X as a woven textile to supply
F (depending, Obviously, in which states they validate the patent).
Ifthe designation fees are not paid for NF-EU2 then it will not act as Art. 54(3) prior
art against NF-EUI. Claims in NF-EUI to the process for producing continuous fibres,
although they cannot claim priority, were still novel and inventive at the date of
