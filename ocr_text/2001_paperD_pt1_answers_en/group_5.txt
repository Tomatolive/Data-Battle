Bug, since it was not sent at least 10 days before the deadline, a surcharge ofEIJR 153
must be paid (RFees 8(3)(b)) for the original cheque to be deemed received in time.
So request for further processing would be validly filed as long as the EUR 153 surcharge
is filed within a time limit to be set by the office (RFees 8(4)).

Examination fee for divisional is not due until 6 months after publication of
search report for divisional (A. 94(2)).
if no examination fee (A. 94(2)) paid for patent, application is deemed withdrawn
(A. 94(3)) at the end of the standard six-month time limit under A. 94(3) (J 4/86).
The divisional could have been filed during the grace period (R. 85b) but would only be
validly filed if examination fee was paid during that period. So divisional not validly
filed.
No remedies — A. 94(2) period and R. 85b period are convention time limits, so further
processing (A. 121) is not possible. The A. 94(2) period is specifically excluded from
restitutio (A. 122(5), G 5/92). The R. 85b period is also excluded from restitutio (J
8/94).
Divisional can be validly filed.
Refusal for lack of unity (A. 82) will not have come about fmrn a convention time
limit, and the application is lost.
So further processing (A. 121) is possible.
Refusal decision (A. 121(2)) was deemed received 28.1.01 (R. 78(2)).
Two months from then is 28.3.01 — today.
So — today — letter to EPO meeting unity objection, pay further processing fee,
preferably by deposit account debit. Then pending application exists & divisional can
be filed. (Note divisional cannot be filed if fixrther processing is not requested).
Other alternative is to file appeal (A. 106(1 & pay fee — also today — meeting unity
objection so interlocutory revision (A. 109) is issued. Again, this means divisional can
be filed.
Technically the divisional application should be filed at the latest with the approval
under R. 51(4) (R. 25<1)).
However, J 21/94 said that the approval of the text in such circumstances was
"conditional" on the filing of the divisional — since the approval letter explicitly stated
that a divisional was being filed — SO On the principle of good faith the filing of the
divisional must be valid.
