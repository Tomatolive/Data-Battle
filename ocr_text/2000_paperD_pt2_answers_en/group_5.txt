If they obtained a European patent they could prevent Sadly Resources selling
SAD PROT for use as a medicament. However if Sadly Resources obtain a patent
for SAD PROT per se they could prevent the US Air force selling SAD PROT for any
purpose in the countries where protection is secured (probably GB, DE, FR). Thus,
there would be a potential to negotiate a cross licence with the American Air force
whereby Sadly Resources give permission to sell SAD PROT in return for permission
to sell it as a medicament.
As any patent application filed by the American Air force would post date PROT EU-I
it could not affect progress Of PROT EU-I or any divisional which would benefit from
the filing date Of PROT EU-I.
General
To be cited in the search report the PCT application must have been published. As it
was not entered into the nat. US or reg. EP phase it cannot hinder the exploitation of
SAD ENZ in those countries.
Publication Of PCT rules out protection being sought for SAD ENZ per se.
Protectable inventions appear to be Fat Cat's high yield process and the activitiy of
SAD ENZ, ie use as a medicament both generally and for treatment of obesity/as a
slimming aid.
TO obtain protection for Fat Cat's high yield process it is necessary to retain 7/4/99
priority date of FAT EU — due to subsequent disclosure of process by Dr Puss in
interview in newspaper report. FAT EU will be considered withdrawn through failure
to pay filing and search fees in time.
Refund to fees paid on ENZ EU cannot be obtained. Filing fee cannot be refunded and
search has been carried Out therefore search fee cannot be refunded — A. 10 RRF.
Situation
Take assignment Of FAT EU.
File new application (preferably PCT to keep options open and costs down for next two
years) directed to:
Fat-Cat's method of producing SAD ENZ and activity of SAD ENZ (ie combination
of FAT-EU + ENZ-EU). Claim priority from both FAT EU and ENZ EU.
Application will need to be filed by 9 April 2000, (A. 8 PCT + A. 4 Paris Convention).
Priority can be claimed from European Applications as they are equivalent to a regular
national filing (A. 66 EPC) as required by A. 4 A(2) Paris Convention.
Designate all states, therefore keep options open whilst paying max. 8 x designation
fee. (R 4.9(a) PCT + PCT Fee Schedule)
Deadline is close, can file application by fax on last day if necessary at UK or
European office (at least, but UK]EP probably most convenient).
