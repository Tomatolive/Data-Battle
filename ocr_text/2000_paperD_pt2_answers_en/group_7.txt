Altematwe would be to abandon ENZ ELJ and file a new PCT application claiming
priority of ENZ EIJ. The application should be filed in the name of Sadly Research with
Dr Plump being named as applicant for the US â€” if designated.
Otherwise I would recommend proceeding with the PCT application in the manner
outlined in relation to that proposed for situation as above.
Were Fat Cat to file a new application claiming priority from FAT EU they could
prevent Sadly using the high yield process described in FAT EU, but could not stop
sadly using the low yield process described in the Genie Genie PCT application.
Without cooperation from Fat Cat, Sadly Research cannot obtain protection for the
high yield process as a claim to priority from FAT EU is essential for this, because Of
the newspaper article disclosing the process subsequently.
Protection cannot be sought for SAD ENZ per se due to its disclosure in GG's PCT.
