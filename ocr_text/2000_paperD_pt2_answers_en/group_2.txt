In order to obtain protection for SAD-FORM in Europe, FORM-EU2 should be
continued, bearing in mind that this may also cover SAD FORM 2.
Assuming that FORM EU-2 iS still pending•, next action required will probably be to
pay designation fees and request examination (including paying examination fee),
if not already done so, within 6 months of publication of the European search report,
(A. 94(2), A. 79(2) EPC). Extension fees for any extension states should also be paid
then. Renewal fees will also be payable from end of July 2001 (A. 86, R. 37 EPC).
TO seek protection for SAD-FORM 2 (on basis this does distinguish over SAD-FORM
and/or on basis that it is worth attempting to seek protection, in any event, because Of
commercial importance) and the new invention using Oil I would recommend the filing
of a new PCT application directed to SAD-FORM 2 and the new method of mixing the
pharmaceutical with Oil.
The application should designate all available states, which is quite economic as the
maximum number Of 8 designation fees would be payable under R. 4.9a PCT, PCT
Schedule Of fees.
Sadly Resources should be applicant for all states except US where inventor(s) should
be named as applicants, to meet requirements of US law. It may be necessary to take
an assignment from Gobbleup and/or name other inventors depending upon who
invented the oil's development.
Application should Claim priority from FORM EU-2, but would only be entitled to the
benefit of the filing date Of EU2 in respect Of the matter mentioned in EIJ2 but not in
FORM I-JK-I , ie: SAD FORM 2. That is, the subject matter for which FORM-EU2 is
the first filing.
Claiming priority from EIJ2 will be essential if EU2 has been published, if valid
protection in other countries were to be sought. EU2 would be published under
A. 93 EPC as soon as possible after 18 months from its priority date, ie soon after
26/1/2000 and has therefore most likely been published.
TO defer costly entry in the national/regional phase of the PCT application a demand
for the International Preliminary Examination Should be filed within 19 months Of
priority, A. 39 PCT. That is 19 months from 26 July 1999, this is 26/2/2001. This will
delay the deadline for entry into the national/regional phase until at least 30 months
from the priority date, 26/7/99.
This will give the company the 18 months it requires to assess the commercial value
Of the inventions as well as a preliminary view on patentability at less cost than filing
individual national applications.
Preliminary examination fee and handling fee to be paid within 1 month Of subrnission
of demand, R. 57.3, 58.1(6) PCT.
• (can infer that FORM EU-2 is pending because search report has issued)
