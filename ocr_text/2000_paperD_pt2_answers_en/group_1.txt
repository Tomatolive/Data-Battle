Candidate's Answer on Paper D, Part II
2.
FORM-EU2 contains a description of both SAD FORM and SAD FORM 2.
SAD FORM is also disclosed in FORM I-JK-I from which priority is claimed. On
the assumption that FORM-EIJ2 validly claims priority from FORM I-JK-I the subject
matter common to both applications will be entitled to the benefit Of the priority date
of FORM UK-I, ie 24 July 1998 (A. 87/88 EPC).
It appears that priority has validly been claimed under A. 87 EPC because the twelve
month period for doing so, running from the filing date Of FORM I-JK-I , would be
extended until 26 July 1999 under R. 85(i) EPC because 24 & 25 July 1999 were
days on which at least one of the filing offices of the EPO was closed.
Therefore, it appears that a valid patent can be obtained for the subject matter
common to both FORM-UKI and FORM-EU2, ie SAD-FORM, because the article in
the Journal Of Soap Chemistry was not published until 1 April 1999, after the filing Of
FORM UK-I.
Whether valid protection can be obtained for SAD FORM 2 is uncertain.
The Soap Chemistry journal will be prior art under A. 54(2) EPC in relation to any
claims Of FORM EU-2 directed to SAD FORM 2, because these claims will not be
entitled to the benefit of the priority date of FORM-UKI , even though they may
contain matter from FORM-UKI. This follows from 63/93.
Whether valid protection for SAD FORM 2 per se can be obtained will depend upon
whether claims to SAD FORM 2 distinguish inventively over the disclosure the
Soap Journal article. (A. 56 EPC).
We are told SAD FORM 2 is commercially very important, this could be an indication
that it improves over SAD FORM and is therefore arguably not obvious over
SAD-FORM.
Whether or not protection can be obtained for SAD FORM 2 per se, claims to
SAD-FORM may well (and probably do) cover SAD FORM 2 as SAD FORM 2 iS
described as an â€¢embodiment of SAD FORM". Would need to check this.
so far as SAD-FORM is concerned it is no longer possible to file priority claiming
applications directed to this invention, because more than 12 months has elapsed
from the filing Of FORM UK-I , the first application for that subject matter.
A. EPC, A. 4 C(2) Paris Convention.
It is also too late to file a non priority application in the US as over a year has elapsed
from publication of the Soap Joumal article on 1 April 1999. Cannot therefore take
advantage of the 1 year grace period.
Protection for SAD-FORM cannot be obtained Via non-priority applications elsewhere
because of disclosure of SAD-FORM in Soap Journal article.
