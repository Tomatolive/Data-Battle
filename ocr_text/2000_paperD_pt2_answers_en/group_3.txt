Further thoughts on auestion
Could publication Of Soap Journal article be non-prejudicial to FORM-EU under
A. 55(1 EPC because it was an evident abuse in relation to Sadly Resources and
FORM-EU was filed within 6 months of I't April 1999?
Unlikely because Blowit appears to be within the terms Of his agreement with Sadly
Research because he did not disclose anything until filing Of FORM I-JK-I and then
no more than the contents of FORM UK-I.
3. Because the 12 month priority term has expired it is no longer possible to file new
applications claiming priority from PHOT-EUI.
It will not be possible to obtain valid protection for the contents Of PROT-EUI by filing
any new applications because PROT-EUI will have been published under A. 93 EPC,
as soon as possible after 18 months Of its filing date ie, Soon after 14/7/98. It will also
not be possible to obtain valid protection for the use Of the protein SAD PROT as a
medicament because of the disclosure of its use as such in the American Air Force
article published last week.
Basis for any valid protection must be PROT EU-I.
Notification Of communication from the Examining division will be deemed to have
taken place ten days from its date of despatch, ie 14 September 1999 (R. 78(2) EPC).
Extended 6 months term would expire 14/3/2000, R. 83(4) EPC. Deadline for reply
would be 15/3/2000 under R. 85(1) EPC.
It is therefore too late to respond. Application will therefore be deemed withdrawn
under A. 96(3) EPC. [We do not know if the two month extension request was
granted — it probably was in accordance with Guideline E VIII 1.61
A communication noting this will be (or may already have been) despatched under
R. 69(1) EPC.
It will still be possible to proceed with the application by filing a request for further
processing in Writing, paying the fee for further processing and responding to the
communication from the Examining division within 2 months Of notification Of the
communication under R. 69(1) EPC. See A. 121 EPC
Even if the communication under R 69(1) EPC was dispatched 16/3/2000 there is
still time to request further processing.
Need to check if R. 69(1) communication has been received and note deadline, if not,
it is possible to request further processing before receipt of R. 69(1) communÉation.
When responding to the examination repott appropriate arguments/amendments
should be submitted with a view to seeking protection for the method Of isolating the
protein.
Protection is also to be sought for SAD PROT, which is disclosed in PROT EU-I.
