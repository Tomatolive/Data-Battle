It will probably not be possible to introduce a claim to SAD PROT because it would
relate to unsearched subject matter and would thus not be admissible under
R. 86(4) EPC. May be worth trying, though, to obtain view of Examining Division by
filing amended claims in response to communication.
If introduction Of a claim to SAD PROT is not allowed, or in any event, a divisional
application could be filed under A. 76 EPC, claiming SAD PROT.
Deadline for filing a divisional would be deadline for approval Of text Of PROT EU-I
to be granted. This may not be for Some time, nevertheless a divisional can be filed
at any time before then.
Would need to file at EPO in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. Search, filing, designation
fees would need to be paid within One month Of filing R. 25(1) EPC. Renewal fees in
respect of 3'd and 4"' years would be due within four months of filing, R. 37(3) EPC.
Examination fee would also need to be paid, within 6 months Of publication Of search
report on divisional — A. 94(2) EPC.
Only states designated in PROT EU-I may be designated in divisional. A. 76(2) EPC.
Need to check if 4th year renewal fee, due 31/1 /2000 under A. 86(1), R. 37(1) EPC,
in respect Of PROT EU-I Was paid. If not, it can be paid up until 31/7/2000 under
A. 86(2) EPC.
It should be possible to seek valid protection for the isolation process and SAD PROT
(subject to prior art) in I-JK, France and Germany — the countries designated in
PROT EU-I and which can be designated in any divisional.
Further States cannot now be designated. PROT EU-I filed 14/1/97 — designation
fees due one year from filing under Old Article 79(2) EPC, even taking into account old
precautionary designation system, and transitional provisions for new A. 79(2) EPC it
is too late to add other designations now.
Designations could not, in any case, usually be added after publication Of the
application J 3/81.
Details Of SAD PROT will have been disclosed on a publication Of PROT EU-I ,
probably in July 1998.
Any application for a European patent for SAD PROT per se with a priority date after
July 1998 would therefore not result in valid protection. The American Air Force's work
was carried out in 1999 so they cannot have filed an application directed to
SAD PROT before publication Of PROT EU-I. Therefore they cannot get valid
protection for SAD PROT per se.
They may, however, be able to get protection for the use Of SAD PROT in Europe as
a medicament, particularly for treating jet lag, if they filed an appropriate European
patent application or foreign patent application from which priority could be claimed
prior to publication Of the results Of their research work.
