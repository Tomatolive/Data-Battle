Zeus Cameras is being difficult with us in a different matter. Our subsidiary, Leda
Optical, based in Slovakia, developed a new and inventive chip for digital cameras. Leda
Optical first filed a European patent application Leda-EP in December 2001 after
intensive prior art searching. Leda-EP describes and claims the chip. Leda Optical filed
a PCT application, Leda-PCT, in December 2002 designating Europe, Japan and USA.
Leda-PCT has an identical description and claims to, and validly claims priority from,
Leda-EP. Leda-EP has been withdrawn.
Leda made their first sales Of their chips in April 2002, to Klondyke Kompakt Kameras in
the USA which used them in a camera sold only in America. No sales by Leda Optical
have been made since, but Klondyke intended to use the chip in their next generation Of
digital cameras, and Leda Optical expected an order in the next few months. However,
Klondyke has now written to Leda Optical about a letter they have received from Zeus,
complaining that Klondyke's digital cameras incorporating Leda Optical's chip infringe
their patent Zeus-EP and threatening Klondyke with infringement action if they sell into
Europe. Zeus has also asked Klondyke to reveal the source Of the chips. Zeus made it
clear in their letter that they do not have a US application corresponding to Zeus-EP.
Klondyke have asked why they should not buy the chips from Zeus rather than from
Leda Optical.
Zeus-EP designates all EPC states and was filed November 2001 , published May 2002,
granted January 2004 with claims as filed, and has claims infringed by Leda's chip. The
chips described in Zeus-EP and Leda-PCT are identical.
