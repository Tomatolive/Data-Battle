Modem electronics make it feasible to incorporate the basic software, the circuit, and the
improved software in a pocket digital camera.
At a public conference last month Oedipus Electric disclosed in writing the basic
software and the use of the basic software in a camera. Oedipus Electric has received
many enquiries since then. We are very excited by this and wish to obtain patents for the
basic software, the circuit, the improved software, and anything else you think inventive
relating to digital cameras.
We have an assignment document signed by Oedipus Electric transferring Oedipus-EP
to us. We ask that you record the transfer at the European Patent Office, and protect Our
inventions in USA, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Czech Republic. The
Czech Republic is important to us, since that is where our main competitor Zeus
Cameras is situated and has its only factory.
We are convinced that these technologies are important and we would like to ensure the
maximum duration of protection for each invention.
Please advise whether valid patent protection is obtainable for our inventions, and
as to what applications and actions are necessary for us to get such protection in
the name Of Electra Optic ensuring the maximum duration Of protection.
