Your client is Electra Optic, a Finnish company making optical and electronic devices
such as cameras. They write to you as follows:
"We have just acquired a small company, Oedipus Electric (which shall continue to exist
as a separate legal entity), a Greek company which has developed image enhancement
software for digital cameras. We found that on April 2003 Oedipus Electric filed as a
first filing a European patent application Oedipus-EP describing and claiming a method
Of image enhancement using this software and a digital camera having the software
stored on it. The inventor, Miss Myopia, remains with Oedipus Electric and is keen to
develop this technology further.
Their software is in fact identical to software invented by Dr. Panopticon (our employee)
in 1997 (the "basic software"). At that time we filed a Finnish patent application Electra-
Fl. Electra-Fl describes and claims not only the basic software but also a particularly
effective circuit for performing the basic software. This circuit is not obvious from the
basic software and is not disclosed in Oedipus-EP. In 1997 we filed a European patent
application Electra-EP claiming priority from Electra-Fl. In Electra-EP we additionally
describe and claim some further novel and inventive improvements to the basic software
that in fact Oedipus Electric have not thought Of (the "improved software"). The size and
cost of the electronics made use of the invention possible only on a desk top computer
and this was the only embodiment disclosed in Electra-Fl and Electra-EP.
In the absence of a market we withdrew both Electra-Fl and Electra-EP before
publication. Our intention was to keep the idea secret until the economics were
favourable. We are sure that Miss Myopia developed the basic software independently
Of Dr. Panopticon. They agree on this and intend to publish a joint paper discussing the
history of the software after Oedipus-EP is published.
