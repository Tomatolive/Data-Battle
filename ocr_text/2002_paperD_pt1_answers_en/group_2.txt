Renewal fees: due 31 May 2001 or 31 November 2001 under Art. 86(2) EPC with
surcharge. Assuming cause Of non-compliance removed on receipt of 14 October
communication, two month deadline for requesting restitutio has passed.
The only possibility for saving the application would be if the applicant only became
aware Of missing the deadlines for paying renewal fees and for responding to the
communication on 19 March 2002 when bankruptcy proceedings terminated. This would
be the case if, for example, the communications under Article 86(2) EPC and
Article 96(3) EPC were not received by the applicant.
In this case, we should request restitutio in the terms for responding to the 96(2)
communication and paying the renewal fee, pay the fees for restitutio and the renewal
fee and file the response to the 96(2) communication within two months of 19 March,
thus 19 May 2002, extended to 21 May 2002 (Rule 85(1) EPC) and prove all due care
was taken (Art. 122(1) and (2) EPC).
nb — the 1 year periods from the initial deadlines Of 21 November 2002 and 31 May 2002
have not yet expired (Art. 122(2) EPC).
3.1 ) Yes. A priority claim can be added under Rule 26bis PCT. The convention year
(12 months) had not expired. Filing date of 19 December 2001 is within 12 months of
27 December 2002 (Art. PCT and Art. 4A and 4C Paris Convention).
Pirority can be claimed from a utility model — Article 4F(2) Paris Convention.
The priority claim must be added by 27 April 2002, extended to 29 April 2002
(Rule 80.5 PCT) (Rule 26bis.1(a) PCT) as this is 16 months from the earliest (here the
new priority date).
3.2) The certified copy is due by 27 April 2002, extended to 29 April (Rule 80.5 PCT)-
Rule 17.1 (a) PCT. If the certified copy is received by the int. Bureau before the
application is published at 18 months (not before 27 June 2002) it will be deemed
received in time Rule 17.1 (a). If the certified copy is available by then we should submit
it directly to the intemational Bureau.
Even if the certified copy is not available by then, each designated or elected office must
give the applicant an opportunity to furnish the certified copy in the national phase
(Rule 17.1(c) PCT).
