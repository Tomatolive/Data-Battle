6b) Assuming all renewal fees are paid, both EPI and EP2 expire 20 years from filing
(Art. 63(1) EPC), on 12 December 2017. Article 76(1) EPC provides that the date of
filing of EP2 is the date of filing of EPI since no subject matter was added to EP2 on
filing (it contains the same description as Epl
7a) Priority date is valid.
Art. 87(1) EPC — can claim priority within 12 months of earlier filing. 12 m expires on
16 Feb 2002, but is extended to 18 Feb 2002 (Rule 85(1) EPC). The claim is filed in time.
The claim was correctly in the request for grant (Rule 26(2)(g) EPC).
That the Dutch application was subsequently deemed withdrawn does not matter — Art.
87(3) EPC.
b) The priority claim is not valid, and probably cannot be corrected. The declaration was
not filed in time as the 19 March 2002 letter will not have been received within the 12
month period of Art. 87(1) EPC.
A correction under Rule 88 EPC to add the prority claim is unlikely to succeed, but may
be allowable following J 9/91 (Omission of a priority claim is almost always an error).
J 6/91 — the burden of proving the facts is heavy. A correction should be requested
beforepublication and in time for the priority claim to be included in the publication — J 14/82.
7c) The priority claim is not valid but can be corrected
The declaration was made in time under Art. 87(1 ) EPC (see(a)) and was correctly in the
request for grant under Rule 26(2)(g) EPC, but the declaration does not correctly
indicate the date or state of the earlier application.
The date and state can be corrected under Rule 88 EPC but this must be done in time to
publish the corrected priority claim, J 14/82, J 6/91. 18 Feb 2001 is a Sunday which may
help to show that the original declaration was erroneous.
8. Yes, if the request was sent by airmail and using one Of the recognised delivery
services (Guidelines E-Vlll, 1.7), and OJ EPO 1999, 45 — Decision of the President.
Rule 84a applies. The request will be deemed received in time as it was delivered to
delivery service 6 days before the deadline (deadline for claiming priority is 10 October
2001 — Article 87(1 ) EPC)_ It was received within 3 months of the deadline. The priority
declaration was therefore deemed to be made within 12 months (Article 87(1 ) EPC) from
the priority date.
A certified copy of the priority application need not be filed since it is available to the
EPO under Rule 38(4) EPC (OJ EPO 1999, 80 — Japanese patents are included in the
file free of charge).
Ms Sumo must either provide a translation of the priority document (Article 88(1 ) EPC)
or, more simply, a declaration under Rule 38(5) EPC that the European application is a
direct translation Of the Japanese application. The translation or the declaration must be
