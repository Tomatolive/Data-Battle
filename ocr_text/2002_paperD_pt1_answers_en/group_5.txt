filed within the period for replying to the Rule 51 (6) communication or earlier if requested
by the EPO (Rule 38(5) EPC). This will complete the requirements Of Article 88(1 ) EPC
9. Yes, furthermore the appeal fee should be refunded.
Unity Of invention is not a ground Of opposition under Article 100 EPC, further G 1191
states that unity of invention is irrelevant in opposition proceedings even if the patent as
amended does not meet the requirements for unity.
The Opposition Division's decision to revoke the patent on this ground is therefore a
substantial procedural violation.
I therefore recommend that we file a notice of appeal and pay the appeal fee by 18 May
2002 (Article 108 EPC) (extended to 21 May 2002 under Rule 85(1) EPC). We should
also request a refund of the appeal fee under Rule 67 EPC setting out our reasons.
The Opposition Division may well rectify its decision under Article 109 EPC (interlocutory
revision) and, since the dependent claims 2 and 3 appear to be patentable, will maintain
the patent as amended.
The refund of the appeal fee should be allowed since it is equitable according to
Rule 67 EPC.
IOa) Yes, a Greek lawyer may act as the professional representative as long as he is
entitled to act as a professional representative in patent matters under Greek national
law (Article 134(7) EPC). Mr Ouzo must also file a signed authorisation under
Rule 101(1) EPC.
b) The IPER was prepared by the EPO, so a 50% reduction in the examination fee is
obtained (Rule 107(2) EPC).
Mr Ouzo is entitled to use Greek for the examination request as he is Of Greek
nationality (Article 14(4) and (2) EPC) and a 20% reduction in the examination fee is
given under Rule 6(3) and RFees 12(1) EPC.
The total fee payable is reduced by 50% and the thus reduced amount is reduced by
20% (Notes Ill, 6.2 to Form 1200). If the regional phase were entered today, 20 March
2002, the total fee would be EUR 1430, with 40% of this total payable.
