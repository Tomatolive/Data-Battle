Candidate's Answer — Dl
1. Yes. Rule 18 EPC states that the inventor's name will be published unless he waives
his right to be mentioned. A-III, 5.1 of the Guidelines: the waiver must be received in
time to be effective, ie before publication and before technical preparations have been
completed under Rule 48 EPC
I therefore recommend filing a waiver Of Mr Man's rights under Rule 18 EPC in good
time before seven weeks prior to 18 months from priority as this is when technical
preparations for publication are completed (Rule 48(1 ) EPC and OJ EPO 1993, 55.
2a) Rule 90 EPC applies. The applicant was not able to act due to legal reasons
(Rule l)(b) EPC) so the proceedings are automatically interrupted from the date Of
incapacity, 5 December 2001. Bankruptcy is included within Rule EPC — J 7/83,
J 26/95.
I would therefore write to the EPO immediately to inform them of the bankruptcy and
request interruption from 5 December 2000 to 19 March 2002.
Response to communication: communication (96(2)) was issued after the interruption.
The 4 month period begins again on 19 March 2002 (Rule 90(4) EPC). A response must
be filed by 19 July 2002 (Friday).
Renewal fees: the renewal fee was due on 31 May 2001 (Art. 86(1 ) EPC and
Rule 37(1 ) EPC). The time limit for paying renewal fees does not begin again
(Rule 90(4)) after interruption, nor is it interrupted since it is not a "time limit",
J?187 OJ EPO 1988, 323, but the due date is deferred to the date proceedings are
resumed (J?/87), 19 March 2002. This has passed, but the renewal fee can still validly
be paid with a 10% surcharge (Art. 86(2) EPC) up to 19 September 2002.
The date Of resumption Of proceedings is set by the EPO (Rule 90(2) EPC). However,
for the purposes of these time limits, I have assumed that proceedings are resumed Qn
19 March 2002, the earliest date on which resumption could take place. If a later date
were set by the EPO, further time may be allowed and it may be possible to pay the
renewal fee without the surcharge of Article 86(2) EPC.
2b. If bankruptcy did not bar action, Rule EPC does not apply
(Rule 90(1)(b) EPC requires "prevented from continuing proceedings"
96(2) communication:
96(3) communication was notified on 28 December 2001 (Rule 78(2) EPC). Two months
from this date has already expired so further procesing cannot be requested (deadline
28 Feb 2002, Art. 121 Restitutio is also not possible as this must be requested by two
months from receipt of the 96(3) communication (Art. 122(2); Rule 78(2) does not apply
— J 7/82), assuming the Rule 96(3) communication was the cause Of non-compliance.
The application cannot be saved, in this case.
