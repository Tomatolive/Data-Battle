a)
In the present circumstances, there is no legal basis for a reimbursement
of the international search fee. The conditions set out in Article 5 of the
Agreement between the EPO and WIPO of 31.10. 2001, OJ EPO 12/2001, 601 or
Rule 16.2 PCT are not fulfilled
b) The present claim IS directed to a surgical method, and would not be
patentable because of lack of industrial applicability under Article 52(4) EPC The
applicant should file amended claims directed to the heart implant and enter the
regional phase within 31 months according to Rule 107(1) EPC It is noted that
the time limits for entering the regional phase before the EPO do not change in
case of a declaration under Article 17(2) PCT, refer to Article 22(2) PCT. Having
entered the European regional phase, substantive examination will take place.
The declaration according to Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT takes the place of the
European search repoll under Alticle 157(1) EPC If the prior art found in the
additional search (according to the procedure outlined in Guidelines C-VI, 85 or
8-111, 42 ii, or a-VIII, 6) is not pertinent, a patent can be granted for a claim
directed to the heart implant.
Yes, it is possible under Rule 4.10(a)(i)-(iii) PCT. Thailand is a member of the
World Trade Organisation (It is noted that Thailand is not a signatory' to the Paris
Conventiony However, if priority is to be claimed from such a Thai application, it
should be checked which of the designated states of the PCT application have
filed a derogation to Rule 4.10 (refer to the Editor's note to Rule 4.10 PCT)_ It is
noted that the EPO has informed the 1B of WIPO of such a derogation, and thus
would not recognize such a priority claim.
