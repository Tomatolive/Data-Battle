Possible Solution of Paper D, Part I
According to Rule 68(2) EPC, last sentence, a party may not invoke the omission
of the communication. The decision dated 06.12.2002 is deemed received on
16.122002, Rule 78(2) EPC Hence, the 2 month time limit for filing the notice of
appeal according to Article 108 EPC which ended on 16.0203, extended to
Rule 85(1) EPC, has lapsed. Therefore, such an appeal would be
deemed not filed because the appeal fee cannot be paid in time.

According to Article 97(4) EPC (OJ EPO 2002, 112), EP2 is pending
until 22.04_2003, which is one day before the mention of the grant
Therefore, a divisional application can still be validly filed until that day,
Rule 25(1) EPC
No, since Rule 25 EPC refers to a pending European patent
application, not to a European patent
According to GI/94 (refer to Guidelines D-VII, 7), Article 105 EPC also applies to
appeal proceedings. Intervention is only possible during pending proceedings.
From the moment the first fax is received at 16.09 hours, the appeal is no longer
pending, see T517/97 (OJ EPO 12/2000). An intervention was no longer possible
on the same day at 20.12 hours.
The g month opposition period according to Article 99(1) EPC expired on
19.032003 Opposition can validly be filed by telefax according to Rule 36(5)
EPC in combination with the decision of the president of the EPO dated
26.05.1992 (OJ EPO 1992, 299) (refer also to the Guidelines D-lll, 32). The
opponent is entitled to use Spanish, Article 14(4) EPC
The time limit for filing the translation of the notice of opposition is 1 month from
receipt of the telefax at the EPO according to Rule 6(2) EPC Hence, the
translation of the notice of opposition must be filed by 1404.2003. The amount of
488 Euros corresponds to the opposition fee reduced by 20%, according to Rule
6(3) EPC and Article 12(1) RFees.
The fee is considered to be validly paid if evidence is provided to the EPO that
the order for the transfer was given to a bank before the expiry of the opposition
period on 1003.2003, as set out in Alticle 8(3)(a)(ii) RFees_ A surcharge
corresponding to 10% of the fee is to be paid within a time limit set by the EPO
under Article 8(3)(b) RFees in combination with Article 8(4) RFees because the
order was given only five days before expiry of the opposition period.
