Question 4
(6 points)
On 1 February 2005 an applicant filed a European patent application EP-I describing
and claiming subject-matter A EP-I claims priority from a German national application
DE-I filed on 1 March 2004. DE-I discloses subject-matter A
The search report mentions a German patent application DE-0 filed by the same
applicant and disclosing subject-matter A. DE-0 was filed on 1 June 2003 and was
withdrawn on 1 July 2004.
Due to an internal processing error of the German Patent and Trademark Office, DE-0
was published on 1 October 2004, although the applicant had duly filed the letter
withdrawing DE-0 in order to prevent publication of DE-O.
Does DE-0 form prior art for EP-I?
