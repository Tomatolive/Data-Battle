As Hypenools and Cyberfit will apparently be filing lots of applications, it
would make sense to file a general authorisation under EPCr.101(2) enabling
me to act as representative for all applications where Hypenools is common
representative.
Question 2
i)
Yes
An appeal has suspensive effect (EPCa. 106(1), second sentence). Thus, the
appeal prevents the decision (here, refusal of the application) having legal
consequences until the Appeal is decided (or withdrawn) (J 28/94 & E-XI, 1).
Since during that time a pendJn_g application exists, the filing of a divisional
application is possible (EPCr.25(1); J 8/98; A-IV, 1.1 1)
ii)
My answer would be no.
The suspensive effect of EPCa_ 106(1), second sentence occurs only if an
admissible appeal has been filed (EPCa.108)_ It is irrelevant whether the
appeal is inadmissible from the start or rejected later (J 28/03).
As failure to pay the appeal fee in time (2 months from notification of the
decision to refuse â€” EPCa 108) results in the appeal being deemed not to
have been filed (J 17/82; T 324/90), no admissible appeal was filed and no
suspensive effect arises.
