At the same time, I must request reimbursement of the fee for further
processing. A decision rejecting the request for reimbursement (which is
likely here) is open to appeal, either together with the final decision or
separately (depending on how the ED issues the decision to reject request for
reimbursement: i.e. with final decision or as interlocutory decision with
separate right to appeal EPCa 106(1) (J37/89)_
The appeal would be filed by filing a notice of appeal and paying the appeal
fee (â‚¬1020, Rfees 2(11)) within 2 months from notification of the decision to
reject the reimbursement; and file statement of grounds within 4 months of
that notification (EPCa_ 108).
2)
No.
I would not advise client to have case reviewed by Board of Appeal, because
the reason for requesting the second extension under EPCL 84 was weak.
Suitable reasons, for which I might have advised the appeal are set out at
E-Vlll, 1-6 (e.g. representative or client is so ill that response was not
possible; or extensive experiments required), but none of these apply. Indeed
"foreseeable..._leave", which would apply in this situation is mentioned as an
unsuitable reason. Similarly, current situation does not fit into situation set out
in Notice of VP DG2 28_02_ 1989 (OJ 1989, 180) where a further extension
might be allowed.
