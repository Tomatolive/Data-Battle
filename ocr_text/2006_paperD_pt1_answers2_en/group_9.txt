Question 7
Yes.
10:54 11.03
Although a proprietor cannot terminate opposition proceedings by surrender of
the patent (T73/84), he can get the patent revoke by stating that he no longer
approves the granted text (i.e. the text as unamended) and not providing an
amended text Such a statement is regarded as an amendment to be taken
into account under EPCa.102(3) (see Legal Advice Ll 1/82, paragraph 2),
which means that if no alternative text is provided by the applicant, the patent
cannot be maintained, even in its form as granted (EPCa 113(2)). This was
confirmed in T73/84 and T186/84_
=> Even though the Opposition Division believes the patent to be valid, a
request for revocation by the proprietor (which is regarded as disapproval of
the text as granted T 186/84) will result in the patent being revoked, although
not under EPCa 100(1), (4) or (5) (see L 11/82, third paragraph).
