The demand must be filed in the language of the international application or, if
filed in a language that is not a language of publication, in the language of
publication (PCTr_55_ 1). As German is a language of publication (AGI,
paragraph 54), this exception does not apply. The language of the application
is German.
File the demand in German.
Question 5
Yes.
For the purposes of EPCa54(3) and (4), the effective filing date of EP2 is the
filing date of the Portuguese priority application (EPCa_ 89), i.e. March 2002.
Although the applicant did not file a copy of the priority document within the 4
month period set under EPCa 91(2) and EPCr41(1), the priority right would
have been lost under EPCa_ 91 (3) at the of this period (i.e. November
2003). As this was after the publication date of EP2 (Sept 2003), the loss of
priority right does not effect the application of EPCa. 54(3) and (4) (see C-IV,
6_1a).
Accordingly, EP2 is pan of the state of the art under EPCa_ 54(3) and (4)
because it has an earlier effective filing date under EPCa_89 (March 2002 vs.
January 2003 for EPI) and was published after this date (in September 2003).
We are told that it designated the same states and described the same
invention => it is novelty destroying for all designated states (EPCa 54(3) &
EPCL23d)_
