The notice of opposition was filed by fax on 24th January 2006 => within the 9
month period. Filing by fax is permitted under EPCr_ 36(5) (Dec. of the Pres
OJ 2005, 41). The EPO received the confirmation on 31st Janua1Y 2006.
This is irrelevant as confirmation copies are now only required on request (OJ
2005, 41).
The opposition was filed by an Italian company, who as a company having its
principal place of business in a contracting state with an official language
other than French, German or English (here, Italian (Nat Law Table II, column
4) is entitled to file the Notice of Opposition in Italian (EPCa.14(4)).
The fee was paid by debit order filed on 24th January 2006, which is the date
the fee is deemed paid (Rfees 8(1) and ADA 5(2)), so the fee was paid in
time (EPCa.99(1)_
The translation of the notice of opposition required under EPCa. 14(4) was
required within the lonqer of 1 month from filing the notice of opposition or the
end of the opposition period second sentence). Here, the relevant
date was therefore 1 month from 24th Januan,' 2006, because the time limit
runs from receipt by facsmile (A-IX, 2.5). The translation was therefore need
by 24th February 2006 (Friday - EPO open).
=> Translation filed here, opposition deemed not to be received
(EPCa_ 14(5) & EPCa. 99(1))_ Note receipt of the confirmation copy was
outside the g month period (27.012006) => this would not help
