European applications may not be filed at the sub-office in Vienna, as it is not
an EPO filing office under (A-II, 1 1, OJ 1992, 183 & OJ 2005,
44).
The Vienna sub-office forwarded the application to the EPO as a courtesy
service. However, the date of filing is the actual date of receipt of the
application documents by a permitted office (J18/86 & OJ 2005, 44, para 7).
Therefore, Prof. Piro's application will having a filing date of 6th March 2006.
This is outside the 12 month period for claiming priority from CZ-A, which
expired on 3rd March 2006 (EPCa_87(1); no extension under EPCr.85(1) as
EPO open on 03.03.2006)_ Therefore, EP-A is not entitled to its priority date
and has an effective filing date of 6th March 2005 (EPCa_89).
The public disclosure on 3rd March 2006 is therefore comprised in the state of
the art under EPCa 54(2) (which includes oral disclosures) because it took
place before the effective filing date, and EP-A will lack novelty (assuming the
lecture was enabling (C-IV, T3a)) in light of the lecture.
EP-A should therefore be abandoned (which will mean a refund of the search
fee, if paid (Rfees 10(1)). However, the Czech application is unaffected by
this disclosure and could be pursued if he wants protection there.
