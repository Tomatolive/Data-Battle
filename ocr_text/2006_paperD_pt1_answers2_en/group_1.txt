Candidates' answer
Question 1
Yes.
Under EPCa_59, a European application may be filed by joint applicants, here
HYPER TOOLS + CYBERFIT_ However, joint applicants are forced to act in
common â€” there must be a single address for service (EPCL 100).
Therefore, applications filed in the joint name of HYPERTOOLS + CYBERFIT
should contain the appointment of one applicant as common representative
(EPCr.26(3)_ Therefore, here applications should be filed with the Request for
Grant Form 1001 indicating HYPER TOOLS as the common representative. If
not, the EPO will appoint a common representative in accordance with
EPCL 100(1) (so as an alternative, I could name HYPERTOOLS first on the
Request for Grant).
Once Hypertools is appointed as common representative in this way, as an
Irish company (and therefore a legal person having its principal place of
business within a Contracting State in the sense of EPCa 133(3)), it may be
represented by an employee of that entity (i.e me), even though I am not a
professional representative (EPCa.133 (3)).
However, in order to act as representative, I must be authorised
(EPCa_ 133(3)), in accordance with EPCr. 101. Where there are two or more
applicants, only the common representative (which is HYPER TOOLS), as
noted above, must file the authorisation.
=> File a signed authorisation (signed in name of Hypertools) with each
application filed, or else wait for the EPO the invite me to file an authorisation
for each application under EPCr.101(1 ) (A-IX, 17).
