In Case C, claim
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
Damenill composition (if nQt available under a) above not analysable).
Use for irnproved fuel and heat resistant articles.
Would appear inventive over prior art (a). Only known use was as shock absorbent, no
for fuel and heat resistance.
In Case C, also claim:
(iii) racing shoe having Damenill sole.
(iv) use ofl)amenill for soles of racing shoes.
(iii) and (iv) are certainly novel over prior art a). Case B was filed after Case C and is thus not
relevant. (ii) and (iv) appear to be inventive over even (i) and (ii), since the applicability in a racing
shoe is said to be "surprising".
May want to claim use of Damenill in the systems described in Case B (parent and divisional), for
which th«e appærs to be basis Can also file a divisional application on this if it is important enough
in its own right.
Include claims to in US ex-PCT application derived from case C.
Can include claims to use of Damenill in injection system in US Case B if desired.
Could possibly ask for interruption of procedings under on ground that Overtake was
legally incapacitated by accident, since EPC does not define this. Time limits such as RS I (4) reply
for B would then not have expired. However, this looks unlikely to be agreed to by EPO, since
was another non-incapacitated applicant (D). incapacity may only cover serious mental
illness as discussed in eg Safer to take steps discussed above anyway
