I would advise my client on the basis of the following memorandum:
Reckitt (WR) has been telling people about invention on ABS (invention A).
Advise: file a as soon as possible. Potential claims are to the ABS itself and its
use in racing Cars and in domestic cars.
Relevant potential prior art.
l)
2)
Secret testing by Overtake and her team - secret, not "made available to the public" as
required by Art 54(2) EPC and not relevant.
Disclosures by WR - firstly, his possession of the ABS box may not be such as to make a
disclosure of the invention. The box alone may not "make available" information to the public,
if for instance it is not possible to establish how it works. WR is described as *useless" and may
thus not be able to provide Rarther enlightaunent even if the disclosure is •enabling",
it may be possible to disregard it under Art 55(1 as being as a result Of an "evident abuse*
in relation to the applicant (Overtake). We should have a good Case for arguing this, as tests
were secret and WR's contract probably bound him to Secrecy.
Any disclosures by WR before filing should not be relevant.
Ne«i to file within 6 mth of disclosure, to benefit from grace period in Art 55(1). Need to file in
EPO before end Of April 1997 (firri out exact date of accident from Overtake - earliest possible date
of disclosure by WR).
LISA: File in USA as soon as possible also.
35 USC 1026), non-written disclosures outside USA are not relevant to validity ofa
US patent.
Disclosures by WR will not count against a US patent
Can file provisional (35USCS111) application or regular Both give a US filing date
Provisional is cheaper, but prosecution of regular begins sooner and will need to convert
provisional to regular with 12 mth anyway.
(File in USA anyway, as above).
File Our Own application in EPO in the name of Overtake, as soon as possible - thus ensuring the
invention and its advantages and preferred embodiments are described in optimum manner by us, as
instructed by the inventor.
If WR or Pastawinna (PW) have already filed we Can take action as below but we rnay also, by filing
application in name of Overtake, be able to gain protection for things they have not described. Any
application ofthGrs is highly unlikely to have been published (even if filed in November, not due until
May 1998 under Art l) EPC) and thus is relevant against Our application as a nQY.elty reference
only, under Art 54(3) EPC, for commonly designated EPC states.
