There is an argument that selection of the length gives novelty in this range.
However, this argument is likely to fail. In assessing prior art the entire technical
content must be considered not just the examples (for example, T666/89).
Dl states that a technical effect is achieved over a specified range of undulations per
metre. In the region of overlap, claim 4 simply confirms this. There is no new technical
information and therefore, no novelty over Dl
Dl specifically teaches that in order to obtain better results, the number of undulations
per metre has to be between 5 and 16. For panels having >16 â€” 30 undulations per
metre and a length greater than 3 metres Claim 4 is therefore novel.
Dl teaches that the improved efficiency is not achieved above 16 undulations per
metre. Therefore, in the range >16-30 undulations per metre, it would appear inventive
to go against this teaching of Dl .
However, whether there is basis for claming the range >16-30 undulations per metre
(or a sub-range) in the description of PCTI needs to be established. Whether the valid
priority claim from ITI would be retained for such an amended range or sub-range is
to be considered.
With respect to claim 4, EPB in the European regional phase will form part of the state
of the art under Article 54(3) EPC EPB will be considered for novelty purposes only
for the commonly designated states. The 20 undulations per metre panel embodiment
having a length of 4 metres disclosed in EPB will destroy the novelty of claim 4 for that
combination.
To overcome this problem, a disclamer of the specific combination of 20 undulations
per metre and a length of 4 metres is possible (GI /03 or G2/03)_
As a further improvement, a claim to the use of undulations to improve thermal
efficiency would provide further protection.
With respect to Mr. Bad's proposal to withdraw conflicting embodiments in application
EPB for the three countries (DE, FRI IT) designated in Euro-PCTI , it is noted that
such a withdrawal is not possible.
Further, if Good NV can show that the invention was stolen, Article 55(1) EPC would
then apply because EPB was published after the filing of PCTI_ Also, entitlement
proceedings may be instigated under Alticle 61 EPC_
If sufficient evidence can be collected and such entitlement proceedings are
successful, Good NV should file a separate application directed to the stolen
subject-matter.
