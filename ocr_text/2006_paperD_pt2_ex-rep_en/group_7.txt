The process claim 5 may be infringed by Mr Bad.
It is suggested to request accelerated examination at the EPO to get a quick grant
Further, consideration may be given to entering national phases from PCT 1 directly
where possible to get a quick grant.
Can Mr Bad stop us from marketinq our panels?
No, if Good NV does not market panels using the specific structure claimed in EPB_
At present in EPB, the undulations are only described, but are not claimed.
There may be scope, however, for amended claims or a divisional application that
could cause problems for Good NV.
