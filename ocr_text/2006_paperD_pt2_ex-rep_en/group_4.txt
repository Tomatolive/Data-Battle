At first sight it appears inventive because of technical effect over the claimed range.
But ITI states that the technical effect is not achieved for some combinations of length
and undulations. Therefore, the subject-matter of claim 2 appears not to be inventive
for these combinations of length and undulations. Therefore the subject-matter of
claim 2 may not be patentable.
Limiting Claim 2 to a solar panel having a length of one metre, or adding such a
limited claim, may improve patentability. Such a claim would retain the priority of Dl
Please note, however, that claim 2 cannot be improved by using a disclaimer to
disclaim the non-inventive combinations of length and undulations because this is
relevant to inventive step and has a technical effect (GI /03 & G2/03)_
Claim 3
Claim 3 validly claims priority from ITI and has a priority date of 22/09/2004. The
subject matter entitled to a priority date of 22/09/2004 is solar panels having 5-16
undulations per metre and having a length of less than 3 metres. Claim 3 as it stands
cannot benefit from the priority of Dl or Fl because it includes an additional technical
feature ((33/93).
Claim 3 is novel over Tokyo disclosure.
EPB will be comprised in the state of the art in the European regional phase under
Article 54(3) EPC against claim 3 The embodiment in EPB of a panel having 10
undulations per metre and a length of 2 metres is novelty destroying against the
subject-matter of claim 3. However, this particular embodiment could be disclaimed
(GI/03 & (32/03).
Dl forms part of the state of the aft since Dl was published before filing of ITI
The subject-matter of claim 3 is not patentable over Dl because of the disclosure of
1m test panels in Dl _
Validity of Clam 3 may be improved by limiting to 1m panels if there is scope for such
a generalisation from the examples, since for such a claim, the priority clam from Dl
may be valid [this would be effectively the same as the amended Claim 2 mentioned
above].
Claim 4
Claim 4 validly claims priority from ITI and has a priority date of 22/09/2004.
The subject matter entitled to a priority date of 22/09/04 includes solar panels having
15-30 undulations per metre and having a length of more than 3 metres.
The subject-matter of claim 4 is novel over the Tokyo disclosure because of the
claimed length.
Dl claims 5-16 undulations over all length ranges and overlaps claim 4 in the region
15-16 undulations per metre for panels having a length greater than 3m.
