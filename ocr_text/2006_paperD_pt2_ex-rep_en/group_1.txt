Examiners' Report - Part D II 2006
This year the candidates were asked:
• to assess the validity of a patent application having claims with different priority
dates
• to comment on some procedural issues
• and to advise whether the client could stop or be stopped by his competitor.
In assessing validity the first problem the candidates were expected to discuss was
the effect of a document which was a written repoll of an oral disclosure at a
Symposium.
Most candidates correctly stated that the oral disclosure was prior art as it took place
before the earliest claimed priority date.
Many candidates also noted that the written report was deemed to represent the
contents of the oral disclosure unless proven othemise.
Too few candidates suggested investigation of the oral disclosure (e.g. by contacting
attendees) to determne whether the written document was a correct representation of
the oral disclosure. The effect of any disparity could be large [the client might possibly
maintain their extremely broad claim 1 if the document discloses more than the oral
disclosurel
While candidates are generally expected to accept the facts presented to them, when
those facts indicate the need for specific enquiries, they should say what those
enquiries would be, and what they would hope to demonstrate from those enquiries.
In assessing the effect of the different priority dates, most candidates were able to
correctly attribute the different dates to the different claims. However too many
candidates appeared unaware of G3/93 and attributed the priority of Dl to Claim 3.
Some candidates even seemed to be of the erroneous view that a dependent claim
always has the priority date of the independent claim it depends from.
The majority of candidates appreciated that EPB was Art54(3) prior art against
Claims 3 and 4. However, relatively few discussed the possibility of disclaiming the
specific examples of EPB. Given the relatively recent publication of Decisions GI /03
and G2/03 which set out the requirements for disclaimers, this was surprising.
The most complex part of this question was the relationship between Dl and IT 1, and
the effect this had on Claims 2-4.
Many candidates realised that the disclosure of ITI cast doubt on the technical effect
claimed in Dl , and hence on the inventive step of Claim 2 over the oral disclosure.
