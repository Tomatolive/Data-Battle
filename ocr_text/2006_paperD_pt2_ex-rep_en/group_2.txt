Relatively few candidates discussed the partial validity of Claim 4, in view of its
overlap with the disclosure of Dl, and what options there might be for amendment to
make the claim fully valid.
The procedural questions in this paper were generally well answered.
A relatively small pan of this paper was concerned with questions of infringement or
the commercial effect of the legal situatiom
Those candidates who had thoroughly analysed the legal status sometimes failed to
draw the appropriate conclusions, but most were able to reach a reasonable opinion.
It was reassuring that those candidates who suggested using disclamers to overcome
the prior art effect of EPB generally appreciated that they could not enforce these
claims in the area of the disclaimer.
Those candidates who had a cursory analysis of the situation found it difficult to obtain
marks in assessing infringement issues It must be stressed that before an opinion on
the effect of a patent or application can be given it is necessary to come to a
conclusion as to validity. Also, it should be remembered that candidates are writing a
legal opinion for a client Clients are not only interested in what they cannot do;
they tend to welcome suggestions for what they can do and all aspects as to how the
legal situation may affect their business. Many candidates considered only the legal
situation and did not make any suggestions as to how it could be improved or consider
the business effect.
Candidates who gave structured answers with clear reasons for the conclusions they
reached tended to do well: those candidates who adopted a stream of consciousness
style, or who stated conclusions without giving reasons found it difficult to gain marks.
This is the same every year and candidates are encouraged to adopt an organised
approach to answering DII_ In particular, the order in which questions are posed in DII
may indicate a sensible order to deal with DIL Candidates who deviate from the order
of questions may find the paper more difficult to deal with than those who follow this
order.
