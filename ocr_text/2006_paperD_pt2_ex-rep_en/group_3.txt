Possible Solution - Paper D II
Are each of claims 1 to 5 valid in Euro-PCTI and if not. can we improve them?
Each claim is dealt with in tum below-
Claim 1
Claim 1 validly claims priority from Fl and has a priority date of 1/10/2003
The subject matter in PCTI entitled to a priority date of 1/10/2003:
• a panel having undulating walls,
• use of undulations to increase the thermal efficiency
• and the extrusion process.
The extrusion process is discussed under Claim 5.
The Oral Disclosure at the Symposium in 2002 is before filing of Fl _ It may disclose
the undulations in general and, in particular, 20 undulations per metre for a 1 metre
panel.
During the European regional phase, the EPO will assume the written disclosure
matches the oral disclosure. The article will be considered as indirect evidence of
what was disclosed. If the applicant wishes to overturn this assumption, he will have to
demonstrate that the written disclosure does not correspond to the oral disclosure.
It should therefore be investigated whether the article matches the oral disclosure.
If the article discloses more than what was actually presented at the Symposium in
2002 Claim 1 may be novel. The Proceedings were published only in 2004, which is
after the priority date of claim 1 _
It is further noted that the function of undulations as assumed to be disclosed at the
Symposium is different from the function in PCTI _ Thus, the use of undulations to
improve thermal efficiency may be patentable. Therefore, amendment to use claims or
preferably addition of use claims is advisable
It is noted that the oral disclosure is not considered part of the prior aft for the
purposes of novelty and inventive step in the International phase.
It will only be considered as a disclosure during the national/ regional phases
Claim 2
It is possible to claim priority from a German utility model, i.e. Dl, within one year.
Claim 2 validly claims priority from Dl and has a priority date of 15/03/2004. The
subject matter entitled to the priority date of 15/03/2004 is panels having 5-16
undulations per metre.
The subject-matter of claim 2 is novel over the Tokyo disclosure.
