Claim 5
Claim 5 validly claims priority from Fl and has a priority date of 1/10/2003
There is no reason to doubt the patentability of its subject-matter
Can we extend our Euro-PCTI to cover the United Kingdom and Belqium?
It is possible to pay the designation fees within the 31 months period, i.e. up until
02/05/06.
Is there an easy wav to postpone national phase entry for PCTI outside Europe
without paving surcharges?
To postpone national phase entry withdrawing the priority claim from Fl may be
considered. If the priority claim of Fl is withdrawn, the 30 months period for entering
national phases will end on 15/09/06. It is thus possible to delay entry into the
national/regonal phases for those states where the national/regional phases have not
staned yet.
A disadvantage of such a course of action is that you lose the priority claims for claims
1, 5 and the possible use claim.
It should be noted that some countries have a longer than 30 month period for
entering the national/regional phase without a late filing fee
Can we stop Mr Bad from marketing his panels?
If claim 1 is valid (over Tokyo Symposium) it covers all ranges of undulations and as a
result we can stop Mr. Bad from marketing his panels, since they fall within the scope
of claim 1
If claim 1 is not valid and claims 2 and 3 are unamended then we cannot stop Mr. Bad
from
making small panels (panels under three metres longy Amended claims
covering one metre panels (as suggested above under heading Claim 2 or Claim 3)
may make it possible to stop Mr Bad from making small panels.
For large panels (panels over three metres long) a claim with a disclaimer could not
stop Mr Bad making a panel with 20 undulations per metre having a length
of 4 metres.
If a disclaimer is not necessary following a successful showing of abuse, then Mr. Bad
can be prevented from making such panels.
To improve your position, you should consider the designation of ES to prevent new
sales as Mr Bad has exhibited in Spain. By paying 7 designation fees, you will cover
all designations.
A use claim may make it possible to stop Mr Bad selling panels with undulations for
improved thermal efficiency. The enforcement of such a claim, however, depends on
national law.
To stop ML Bad, it may also be possible to begin a National action based on Fl, ITI
or Dl.
