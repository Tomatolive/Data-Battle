There is one further case (the C case) I would like you to consider for me. At the tirne of
developing the fuel injection system I carried out many experiments to find a Riel and heat
resistant rubber for some of the components. I tested a number Of commercially available
rubbers and one Of the rubbers, trade name "Damenill", which I tested was shown by the
experiments to have superb qualities Of Riel and heat resistance even when very thin.
Surprisingly tNs and Irat resistance makes it an excellent material for the soles of racing-
shoes. Damenill's only previous use has been as a shock absorbing material used in car
I disclosed this invention to the racing-shoe maker, Mike Champion, and he agre«i to take
a licare providai can have rights under granted patents in Europe I used an English
attorney, Ben Etton, to file the case; he filed the case as a PCT application in English
designating Europe and the USA, and paid all fees and carried out all actions
including requesting international preliminary examination on 19 April 1996. The PCT
application itsdfhad filed on 20 1994 as a first filing narning me as applicant
and inventor. I took the case back from Etton after he had requested international
examination, intending to handle the case myself. Owing to work pressures and then the
accident I have done nothing on the case, although I remember receiving a letter from the
EPO about it; howev«, cannot now find the letter Please could you take over this case; you
appreciate ünt it is inwtant to get the European patent granted, if possible to fillfil my
agreement with Mike Champion.
What actions are there to be taken and what fees will you need to pay in the next six
months?
By the way, propertiß of its use for making articles with improved and
heat resistance, together with its composition, are disclosed, but not claimed, in both the
patent application for the racing-shoe and in the patent application for injection
system and pump (the B case).
