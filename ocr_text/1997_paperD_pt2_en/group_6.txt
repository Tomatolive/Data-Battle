Is there any possibility Of getting patent protection for Damenill itself, or its new use
as a fuel and heat resistant material in general?
Yours sincerely,
Donna Overtake
On the letter this morning you telephone the EPO and are told that the B case names as joint
applicants and inventors Overtake and Dipstick. no representative has been appointed NO divisionals
have filed and no renewal fees have been paid, and although the EPO issued a communication on
I November 1996 (with a four month time period) informing the applicant of the text in which it
intended to grant the European patent, no response has been received by the EPO
Write a reasoned memorandum for your Client detailing what actions you will take in her best
interest and answering all her questions.
