PART 11
You have today, 19 March 1997, at your London Offce, the Bllowing letter from a client,
Donna Overtake, the British racing driver, has just len hospital following a serious accident
in her racing car during testing in late October 1996.
Tuesday, 18 March 1997
Dear Mr Tourney,
As you know, the British motor racing team I Own has been working for some time On an
electronically controlled anti-lock braking Systan (ABS) for our racing car. The system is
very advanced and will be of great comrnercial value if we can get the domestic motor
industry interested. We have been carrying out secret testing ofthe ABS at our private test
track and, in åct, it was during one of the testing sessions in late October last year that I had
my accident
My n•wst trust«i mechanic, Dipstick, examined the car aner the accident and found that the
for the accident was that an essential Component ofthe ABS had been removed from
the car; the item removed was the electronic control system which I had invented. I was
planning to visit you to discuss the invention but the accident prevented me.
Dipstick tells tne that Willy Reckitt, Our useless engine expert, was seen walking away from
the car just before the start ofthe last test session carrying a box looking like the ABS control
systan; he was looking very pleased, which is surprising because I had told him his services
were no longer needed and his employment by me was terminated. I am convinced Reckitt
stole the ABS control systern and will probably Inve telling people about it. It is possible
that Reckitt has to Ell the ABS control system and the invention to arch rivals, the
Italian Pastawinna Formula One team; Pastawinna may be our arch rivals but they are
honorable and will be misled by Reckitt's lies.
