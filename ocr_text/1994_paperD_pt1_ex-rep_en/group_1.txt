training for the examination during the years of experience required for

The attached solution to Paper D is much longer than the Committee expects from
candidates as it contains very full explanations. Certainly less is expected
from an average successful candidate. An actual answer paper by a good candidate
is attached for comparison.
Candidates are urged to time themselves, both for the short and long questions ,
leaving a good margin for review. Then time can be used to read the question
carefully and to ansver what has been asked. Hany errors in candidates' answers
vould have resulted in the loss (often irreparable) of a client's rights.

Many failed to appreciate that, in the regional phase, the EPO performs a
supplementary search, considers the question of non-unity and invites
