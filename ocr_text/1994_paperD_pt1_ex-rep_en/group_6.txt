b)
The USPTO as ISA Will only establish a search report for the parts Of the
patent application which relate to the invention first mentioned in the
claims (Art. PCT).
On entry Into the regional phase and payment Of the reduced search fee, the
EPO draw up a Supplementary Search Report (Art. 157 EPC). The
Search Division will consider whether the application complies vich the
requirements of unity of invention (Rule 104b(4) EPC). If this is found not
to be the case, the applicant is informed that a European Search Report can
be obtained for the unsearched parts, if a search fee is paid for each
invention involved Within a period Set by the DLVIsLon (between 2 and 6
weeks) . Search reports are then drawn up for all inventions with fees paid
in time.
As I am a professional representative, the communication of the EPO examiner
Ls deemed to have been delivered to me ten days after posting exactly four
months ago, under Rule 78(3) EPC. The four months time for response
started on the deemed delivery date and ends in ten days time. As I have
instructions not to respond, I will apply for an extension of that time
limit under Rule 84 EPC and Guidelines E-VIII, 1.6, within the next ten
days. No fee is involved. An extension to a total of six months from the
deemed delivery date is thus obtainable, . e. an extension Of months.
If, within that time, no response is possible and you send me details Of
exceptional circumstances explaining why, I can apply with a reasoned
request for a further extension (last sentence Rule 84 EPC), but this VIII
only be for a short period and only exceptionally (Guidelines E-VIII, 1.6,
and Notice of the Vice-President of DG2, OJ EPO 5/1989, 180). Again no fee.
If the reasoned request is unsuccessful or not made, the application vill be
deemed to be withdrawn under Art. 96(3) EPC. Thereafter, the EPO will notify
me of a loss of rights under Rule 69(1) EPC. Then I have tvo months to (i)
file a request for further processing under Art. 121 EPC, (i i) to respond to
the EPO examiner's coanunication, and (i i i) to pay the corresponding fee for
further processing. (Art. 2 No. 12 Rules relating to Fees).
NO.
In order to gave the appl ication, the proceedings would have to be
interrupted under Art. EPC. However, this is not possible because
the dead person is not identical With the appl [cant entered in the Register
of European Patents. For the purposes of proceedings before the EPO,
according to Art. 60(3) EPC, the applicant registered Ln the Register of
European Patents is deemed to be entitled to exercise the right to the
European Patent. As no request for recording the transfer from A to B has
been filed under Rule EPC, no fee pursuant to Rule 20(2) has been paid
and no transfer document has been submitted under Rule 20(3) EPC, there is
no transfer carried out vis-Ã¥-vis the EPO. Consequently, at the date of
death of B, the applicant before the EPO vas still A. A request for
registration of the transfer filed today has no retroactive effect (Decision
J 9/90, EPO Board of Appeal case Lav 1992).
