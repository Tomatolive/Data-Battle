Yes.
Taiwan is not a member of the Paris Convention and therefore the first
application filed in Taiwan on 01.03.93 cannot be used to claim priority for
the International application under Art. 4A(1) of the Paris Convention.
Japan is a member Of the Paris Convention and consequently the Japanese
application filed on 03.0".93 can be used to claim priority, being the first
tiling in a Convention country within the meaning of Art. 4C(2) of the Paris
Convention. As the international application was filed Within the twelve
months period following the first filing, Che claim Co priority right is
valid.
NO.
As the first application filed on 01.03.93 was a Japanese utility model
application, a right of priority based on its filing is available under Art.
IJE(2) Of the Paris Convention for a subsequent patent application filed
within twelve months (Art. OC(I)). Accordingly, as Japan is a member of the
Paris Convention, the Japanese application filed on 03 . 0-4.93 Vas not the
first filing under Art. 4C(2) of the Paris Convention. Thus, because the
international application vas filed on 31.03.94, more than twelve months
after the first filing, it was not possible validly to claim priority for
the application, unless under Art. 4C(4) of the Paris Convention the
Japanese utility model application had been vithdravn, abandoned or refused
before the filing of the Japanese patent application, without being
published, leaving any rights outstanding, or serving as a basis for
claiming priority right.
Inventor A: FR, DE, SE.
Inventor B: DK, IT, NL.
Inventor A filed the A-EP appl after the expiry of the twelve months
period of priority under Art. OC(I) of the Paris Convention, so that the
elain to priority was not available and the date of filing, 05.01.94, was
the effective date. Inventor B filed the B-EP application on 05.02.93 as a
first application and therefore has the prior right for all designated
countries in that application, i.e. FR, DK. IT and NL under Art. 60(2) EPC,
so that Art. 54(3) will apply against A-EP. However, the inventor A filed in
FR on .01.93, so that in FR. Art. 139(2) EPC applies and the prior right
belongs to A. As the A-DE application filed in Germany on
claiming priority from A-FR filed 04.01.93, and as the B-DE application Vas
filed on 03.01.94 claiming priority from B-EP filed 05.02.93, both A-DE •and
B-DE satisfy the tvelve months rule under Art. of the Paris
Convention, and A has the right in DE having an earlier priority date. As SE
was not designated in B•EP, A has the right for SE under Art. 60(2) EPC.
