EPO Form 1001.1 includes a precautionary designation Of all Contracting
States (including DK). A designation only becomes effective upon payment of
the designation fee. This fee is due within one month of filing the European
patent application under Art. 78(2) and 79(2) EPC. This period of time
expired on 03.02 . 94, but the fee can still be paid two months later under
Rule 85a(2) EPC with a surcharge of 501 of the fee payable (Art. 2 No. 3b
Rules relating to Fees). This time Limit expired on 03.04.94, which is a
Sunday. Accordingly, the time 1 is extended under Rule 85(1) EPC to
04. but this is Easter Monday and the EPO is closed until Tuesday
05.04.94, so that the time limit is extended until today. Accordingly, the
advice is to pay today one designation fee and surcharge, specifying DK
as Che country to be designated.
If the European patent application had been filed on 30 Decenber 1993, the
one month period for paying the designation fee expired on 30.01.94, which
is a Sunday, so that it is extended under Rule g5(l) EPC to 31.01.94.
Consequently, the tvo months grace period expired on 31.03.94. Thus Ls
too late to designate DK today.
The European application claims no priority and therefore Art. 79(2) EPC is
applicable, but not Art. 78(2) EPC. Thus only twelve months is given for
payment Of the designation fees, that Is until 04.01.94, Without surcharge.
Taking advantage Of the two months grace period under Rule 85a(2) . the
designation fee could have been paid with surcharge until 04.03.94.
Today, 05.04.94, It is too late to designate DK.
In both b) and c) circumstances, DK national applications could be filed
without claim to priority if there has been no publication of the invention,
because the European patent applications would not have been published under
Art. 93 EPC.
According to the Guidelines C-VI, the applicant is bound by his
approval and can no longer amend the text of the patent to be granted of his
own Volition, but only with the consent Of the Examining Division under
Rule 86(3) EPC. At this stage, only the Examining Division can resume
proceedings and that only if the Division becomes aware of circumstances
rendering claimed subject natter unpatentable. In the present Instance, such
circumstances may be brought to the Division's attention by the applicant,
indicating withdrawal of approval and proposed amendments under Rule 51(5)
EPC. (Decision T 1/92 Is relevant). This should be done by submitting a
request for resumption and, if necessary, a request for a tvo months
extension of the time liruit under Rule
According to the Guidelines C-VI, 4.10, the despatch of the decision of the
Examining Division to grant a patent is binding for the Division, and the
only possible amendments are those allowed by Rule 89 EPC. (This question
has been addressed in the reference to the Enlarged Board Of Appeal pending
under G 1/93 from Decision T 830/91, not yet published in OJ EPO). The
applicant, once the patent has been granted and he has become patentee, can
oppose his ovn patent under Art. IOO(a) EPC (Decision G 1/84). (The question
Of this entitlement hag been referred to the Enlarged Board Of Appeal under
G 9/93 by the Decision T 788/90) .
