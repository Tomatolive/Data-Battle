Oppositions can be faxed according to Rule 36(5) EPC and to the President â€¢s
Decision dated 26 May 1992 in OJ EPO 6/1992, pp. 299, 300. Written
confirmation should follow to satisfy the requirements of Art. that
Decision. However, the faxed opposition is valid even if not signed, because
the EPO has to invite the party concerned to do so Within a time limit
(Rule 6(3) EPC) set at one month (unextendable) by the Decision. In the
present case, the opponent sent a copy of the opposition which vas signed
before requested to do so by the EPO. The Managing Director may be assumed
to be able to sign on behalf Of Company A and satisfy the provisions Of
Art. 33(3) EPC provided that the Company has its residence or principal
place Of business in a Contracting State. Otherwise. the EPO request
the appointment Of a professional representative. In Decision T 665/89 (EPO
Board of Appeal Case Law 1991) , it was confirmed that an opposition was
admissible Ln Similar circumstances.
If the signed copy had not been sent, the EPO would have invited the
opponent to provide the missing copy properly signed within the time limit
of one month specified in Art. of the President's Decision. If the
opponent failed to provide the missing signed copy within that month, the
opposition would be deemed not to have been received.
According to Rules 57 (1) and 58(2) EPC, the amendments must be appropriate
and necessary in order to be allovable. Further. they are admissible if they
can fairly be said to arise out of the grounds of opposition (Decision
T 95/87). The amendments need to satisfy the provisions of Art. 123(2) and
123(3) EPC. As the claims have been limited, Art. 123(3) should not apply,
but it should be checked whether the I imitation can be found in the content
of the application as filed.
The lack of clarity objection made by the opponent is not a ground for
opposition under Art. 100 EPC, but as clarity of the claims is required by
Art. 84 EPC, the Opposition Division should take it into consideration under
Art. 102(3), provided the claims have been amended and if the lack of
clarity arises from the amendments made (Decisions T 23/86 and T 127/85).
The lack of unity objection made by the opponent is not a ground for
opposi under Art. 100 EPC although unity is required by Art. 82 EPC. The
objection is not to be considered in opposition proceedings and is
considered to be irrelevant to the opposition according to a Decision of the
Enlarged Board Of Appeal (Decision G 1/91) . The function Of Art. 82 EPC is
primarily administrative and is not relevant to the validity of the claims.
which is the issue in opposition proceedings. [Rule 61a EPC refers to
Regulations applying to opposition proceedings. namely Rules 26 to 36. but
only applies to documents and Rule 30 EPC does not relate to documents] .
