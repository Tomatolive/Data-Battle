main legal basis of Article 118 EPC when responding.
Question 7.
This question was generally very well answered. Some candidates, though, were
referring to an earlier decision of the President of the EPO on the same matter.
They eventually came up with the same solution but were missing marks.

Although most candidates correctly referred to G8/93, only a few candidates
specifically outlined that a withdrawal of the opposition in appeal proceedings has
the legal effect of withdrawal of the appeal itself. Many candidates did not
recognize the possibility of limitation in national proceedings. Of those that did,
few recognized that this depends on national law.

Article 25 EPC was not sufficient to obtain the full marks.

not answer the question of whether the employees of the EPO can use another
language in the proceedings before the EPO In part (c), a considerable number
of candidates did not distinguish benveen IT SA and CISCO with respect to the
language requirements when filing a divisional application.
