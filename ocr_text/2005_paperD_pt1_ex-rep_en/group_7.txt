The 22 months time limit ends which is today; the 3 months time limit
ended on 09.012005 (Rule 80.6 PCT), extended to because of holiday
(Rule 80.5 PCT), hence the demand has to be filed today.
The demand will only be treated if the Handling Fee, Rule 57.3(a) PCT, (for the
benefit of the International Bureau) and the Preliminary Examination Fee (for the
benefit of the IPEA), Rule 5&1(b) PCT, (both being collected by the IPEA), have
been paid within one month from filing the demand, i.e. until 08.042005 (Friday).
Because the WO-ISA is considered to be the first Written Opinion of the
International Preliminary Examining Authority (WO-IPEA) according to
Rule 66. Ibis(a) PCT, a response has to be filed in order to have the written
opinion reviewed, according to Rule 66.3 PCT.
Answer to question 6.
Companies A and B are different proprietors in respect of different designated
contracting states.
According to Art 118 EPC nevertheless they shall be regarded as joint proprietors
for the purposes of opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office. The
unity of the patent shall not be affected, in particular the text of the patent shall be
the same for all designated contracting states. Hence the proprietors are forced to
act in common.
Therefore A and B cannot pursue separately different sets of claims, Guidelines Dl,
6 (or D VII, 3). Art 118 EPC allows for a deviation from the unity of the patent only
for the case where the EPC provides for exception (e.g. the cited prior art is an
Article 54(3) EPC document designating AT).
Answer to question T
The due sum for the fees for grant and printing was EUR 715
for the 36th page, i.e. EUR 725_-, Art. 2, 8.2 RFees_
Hence the sum of EUR 730.- paid was too large by EUR 5.
- plus EUR 10.
This sum is an insignificant amount in the sense of Art 10 c RFees, see Decision
of the President of the European Patent Office (06.0001), OJ EPO 2001, 521
