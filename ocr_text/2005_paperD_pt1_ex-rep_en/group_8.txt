(or Guidelines A-Xl, 10.1_3), where the limit of the insignificant amount is
determined to be EUR 10 or less.
Hence the EUR 5.- will not be automatically refunded, unless it is expressly
requested that the sum be refunded.
Answer to question 8:
Withdrawal of the opposition by the opponent has to be regarded as a withdrawal
of the appeal, see G8/93 (OJ EPO 1994, 887).
Withdrawal of the appeal by the sole appellant immediately terminates the appeal
proceedings, as follows from G7/91, G8,'91 (OJ EPO 1993, 346,356).
Consequently, the Board of Appeal has no power to consider the patent, and the
decision of the opposition division becomes final. Under these circumstances, a
restriction of the patent before the EPO is no longer possible.
The client may restrict the patent only in national proceedings. In the countries
where this is possible according to national law, the client may initiate an ex pane
limitation.
Answer to question g.
It follows from Article 25 EPC that the EPO shall be obliged at the request of the
competent national court to give a technical opinion.
However, no opinion will be given on the validity and infringement of the
European patent, see Guidelines E-XII, 1 and 2
Answer to question 10.
a) In the written procedure, the attorney may use any official language of the EPOI
Rule 1(1) EPC or Guidelines A-VIII, 2.1, and may therefore use the English
language which is one of the official languages of the EPOI Article 14(1) EPC
The EPO will use the language of the proceedings in the written procedure, see
Guidelines A-VIII, 1 _2 or 21, which is the language of the translation, Article 14(2)
and (3) EPC, i.e. the French language. Amendments have to be filed in the
language of the proceedings, i.e. they cannot be filed in English, Rule 1(2) EPC
