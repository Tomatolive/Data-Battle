Examiners' Report
General Comments:
- Paper D - Part I
Candidates are reminded that a full preparation including a good knowledge of the
Guidelines and official communications published in the Official Journal of the EPO is
necessary to pass the exam.
There are still candidates using outdated legal texts or making reference to superseded
legal provisions. This causes an unnecessary loss of marks.
The Dl paper tests legal knowledge and reasoning. Some candidates ty to obtain
marks by presenting more than one answer to a question leaving it to the marker to pick
a good one. It is not possible to obtain the full number of marks with such a strategy and
often, no marks can be given at all.
As always, it is only possible to obtain full marks if all peltinent legal provisions are cited
correctly.
It is pointed out that the submission of pre-prepared materials as pan of the answer
paper is contrary to the Regulations (see "Instructions to candidates concerning the
conduct of the examination", paragraphs 4. and 5.7, published in Supplement to Official
Journal 12/2004). Such materials will be disregarded for marking.
Question 1
A considerable number of candidates were not aware of the latest notice of the
EPO with respect to the handling of file inspections relating to the international
applications not having entered the European phase. Even some of those
candidates who were aware of this notice did not correctly interpret its content,
thus wrongly suggesting that file inspection is not possible.
The Guidelines E-IX, 6.5, effective at the date of the exam and referring to the
above notice, lead some candidates to a different solution. These candidates were
not penalized.
(N_B: The Guidelines were amended in the meantime in this respect)
