Answer to question 3.
a)
b)
Yes, the opposition is validly filed. One opposition fee suffices according to G3/99
(OJ EPO 2002, p. 347).
The common representative has to notify the EPO. The member of the family first
mentioned in the notice of opposition is the common representative,
Rule 100 (1) EPC, unless a common representative has been designated. If the
common representative withdraws from the opposition proceedings, the first
remaining family member will be the new common representative by application of
Rule 100 (1) EPC (G 3/99, paragraph 20 of the reasons for the decision), unless
a new common representative has been designated.
Answer to question 4:
Substantive examination will start despite the missing priority document, see
Guidelines A-VII, 35 (or C-V,2_ 1). If the result of substantive examination is that
the patentability requirements are not met the application can be refused without
priority document. If the application is allowable, the applicant is informed that the
decision to grant will not be taken as long as the priority document is missing.
The EPO shall not request the applicant to furnish the priority document,
Rule 17.2 (a) PCT (exception to Rule 111(2) EPC), since the requirements of
Rule 17.1 (b) PCT (request timely, i.e. not later than 16 months and payment of the
fee) are fulfilled.

transmission of the ISR and WO to the applicant, Rule 54bis_ 1 (a)(i) PCT,
whichever is later.
