Question 2.
This question was generally well answered. In pan (b), however, many
candidates missed that, according to Rule 57a, an amendment of the claims in
opposition proceedings, including a change in the category of claims, is only
allowable if it is occasioned by grounds of opposition. In part (e), some
candidates, even though citing GI 193, were not able to apply its content to the
specific situation outlined in the question.
Question 3.
Even though most candidates correctly referred to G3/99 for answering to this
question, still a considerable number failed to apply in detail Rule 100 (1) EPC
referred to in this decision.
Question 4:
Nearly all candidates had difficulties with this question. At least some candidates
realized that the requirements of Rule 17.1 (b) PCT had been fulfilled and that the
EPO shall not request the applicant to fumish the priority copy according to Rule
IT2 (a) PCT. Still, very few candidates knew how the EPO would act in such a
situation.
Question 5.
Most candidates correctly responded that it is necessary to file a demand for
International Prelimnary Examination within the time limit specified in new Rule
54bis_ I(a)(ii) PCT. However, a very low number of candidates correctly answered
that, in order to have the WO-ISA reviewed, it is necessary to actually file a
response according to Rule 66.3 PCT. Otherwise, the content of the WC-ISA will
be automatically converted to the International Preliminary Report on Patentability
not having obtained the intended review of opinion.
