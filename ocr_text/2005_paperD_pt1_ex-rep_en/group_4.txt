Question 11:
It was considered not to be a viable solution to file an amendment of the claims
which the Examining Division would not accept, as this does not guarantee that
the Examining Division reopens the examination proceedings. Moreover, further
processing in accordance with Article 121 EPC does not apply in this situation
because there is no complete loss of rights. Some marks were awarded for
proposing to timely file the translation if the translation happens to be ready by
29 March 2005. Another more costly alternative is to file a divisional application.
(N_B: The change to Rule 51 (4) EPC effective 01 April 2005 closes the solution
of requesting the extension of time in the future.)
