The priority claim can be saved by requesting before expiry of the time limit on
25 March 2005, extended to 29 March 2005 (Easter Holidays), Rules 78(2) and
85(1 )EPC, an extension of the period given in the 51(4) - communication Cl , even
if the corresponding actions have already been taken, Rule 51 (4) EPC, second
sentence. This extension then automatically extends the period set under Rule
38(5) EPC, first sentence. The extension can be requested once for a maximum of
two months. This would be sufficient to get the translation of the priority document
filed.

41 (1 ) EPC and to submit the translation of the priority document in reply to this
communication, legal advice 19/99 (OJ EPO 99, 296), see also Guidelines A-III, 6.8
