The request for restoration could be filed at the EPO as Receiving Office under
R26bis3 PCT
Such a request would need to be filed within 2 months from the expiry of the
priority period i.e. by 1/3/10 + 2 m = Saturday 1/5/10, extended
to Monday 3/5/10 under R80_5 PCT.
It would also need to state the reasons for failure to file in the priority period,
satisfying the requirements of "all due caret and include the fee for applying for
restoration PCT; PCT App. Guide Annex C - EPO - fee is €550).
Alternatively, the Applicant could pursue separate restorca6tion requests at the
designated offices for entering the respective national phases, R49ter PCT.
It may well be best to pursue the restoration at the EPO as Receivinq Office
because subject to narrow exceptions designated offices allowing restoration
would be required to accept a positive finding by the EPO under the "due care"
criterion, thus saving money compared to multiple separate requests in the
national phase.
Not al states will accept the restoration of priority under any circumstances, eg JP
(see reservations to R26bis3 PCT. R49ter1g PCT and R49ter2h PCT)_

a)
EP-A must have met the requirements of R40 EPC, i.e
An indication that a European patent is sought,
Information identifying the applicant or allowing the applicant to be
contacted, R40(1 )(b) (the fax number would be sufficient — GL A-II 4.12),
A description or reference to a preceding filed application, R40(1 )(c) (here,
the reference),
The filing date and number of the referenced application, the office (CN)
with which it was filed, and an indication that it replaces (at least) the
description and any drawings, R40(2),
A certified copy of the previous application, R40(3) (NB this can be filed
within 2 months of filing the application according to R40(3) or within
2 months of a communication under R55 EPC, in which case the date of
filing is retained, GL A-II 4.1_5).
The PCT application must contain a request, a description, one or more claims
and an abstract (A3(2)PCT)_
There is no provision in the PCT for filing an application by reference. However,
since it will have been necessary for applicant A to have filed an certified copy of
CN-A to obtain a filing date for EP-A, this implies he will be able to use this
document as the basis for at least the description.
Claims may or may not have been filed on EP-A (not a requirement to obtain a
file date — see above). If not, claims should be added.
The abstract can be added later, if necessary (A11.1 PCT does not require an
abstract to acquire a filing date; it can be added later in accordance with A14
PCT).
However, the priority claim to EP-A will not be valid
The PCT apples A4 of the Paris Convention to determne the conditions for
claiming priority, A8(2)(a) PCT.
