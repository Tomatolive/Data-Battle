Italy has made use of this provision, Nat Law Table VI -Italy
The authentic text in Italy thus contains the range 3-4% (this being narrower than
the text in the language of proceedings 3-40%).
However, Italy is required to allow X to file a corrected translation under A70(4)
PEC, which has legal effect only after the normal post-grant requirements under
A65(2) EPC have been complied with (for Italy, translation of the patent
specification and providing of a declaration by X or his representative on the last
page of the translation that it is in complete agreement with the original, Nat Law
Table IV Italy.
Italy has also made use of A70(4)(b) EPC (Nat Law Table V .2 — Italy) and so
company Y is entitled to continue their use, which was not an infringement
according to the original translation, even after the legal effect of the new
translation take effect, provided that the earlier use was in qood faith.
Thus, it appears that assuming Y did not act in bad faith X is not able to stop Y
from selling the new product.
It would be sensible to contact a local patent attorney or legal practitioner to
confirm this position (and, e.g., whether Y still has the right to carry out other acts
such as licensing).
