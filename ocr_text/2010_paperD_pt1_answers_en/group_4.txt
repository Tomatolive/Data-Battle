According to A4C(2) PC, the priority period, of 12 months (A4C(1) PC), starts
from the date of filing of the first application
EP-A is not the first application, as CN-A was filed earlier by the same applicant
on 1/7/08.
The priority period for this first application, CN-A, has thus long expired (on 1/7/08
+ 12m 1/7/09).
Moreover, the narrow exception of A4C(4)PC does not apply EP-A cannot be
considered the "first application because CN-A has been published and has also
served as a basis for claiming priority.
As such, CN-A as published on 10/1/10 will be prior art for novelty and inventive
step against PCT-A (R33 la PCT) and will destroy its novelty.
(NB there may be an exception as regards the US designation, since under US
law disclosures by the inventor up to 1 year before the filing date are not novelty
destroying â€” US grace period, PCT AG NP Summary USA)

For application PCT-E, the EPO will not carry out a Supplementary European
Search under A153(7) as it was the ISA (Dec. Adm. Council OJ 2007 642, A1).
The EPO will therefore invite the Applicant to restrict PCT-E to the subject-matter
searched in the ISR, R164(2) EPC, PCT-EI.
In order to obtain protection for PCT-E2, a divisional application will need to be
filed (while PCT-E is still pending, GL C-lll 7.11.4.
The divisional application should be filed either with only the claims relating to
PCT-E2 or at least with those claims listed first
For application PCT-IJ, the situation depends on whether the 1 month period for
responding to an invitation to amend the claims after entry into the European
regional phase has expired, R 161 EPC
If this period has QQ! expired, the Applicant should respond to the invitation by
amending the claims so that PCT-U2 is the invention first mentioned in the
clams.
In this case, the EPO will draw up the Supplementary Search Report of A153(7)
EPC based on this invention at least, R164(1) EPC.
The Applicant should then be able to prosecute PCT-U2 directly in PCT-U.
If the period has expired, the EPO will carry out the search of A153(7) based on
the claims now on file If the EPO agrees that there is a lack of unity as set out by
the US PTO in the international phase, the search will be limited to the firs
invention, i.e. PCT-UI, R 164(1) and the Examining Division will invite the
applicant to limit to these claims, RI 64(2)_
Unless the Applicant can convince the Examining Division that the non-unity
finding was wrong, it will then be necessary to file a divisional application to
pursue PCT-U2, while PCT-U remains pending, R36(1)_

A70(1) EPC holds that the authentic text of the European paten is that in the
language of the proceedings before the EPO
A70(3) EPC however allows contracting states requiring a translation into one of
their official languages to consider this translation to be regarded as authentic,
except in revocation proceedings, if the translation is of narrower scope.
