(Nat Law Table IV)
(NB DK and FRS' requirements are a consequence of their membership of the
London Agreement- OJ 2001 550; OJ 2008 123.)
Claims fees are required in respect of the 16th and each subsequent clam,
R45(1) EPC.
Thus, 10 claims fees are payable as there are 25 claims.
The total fee is 10 x €200 = €2000 (Supplement to OJ EPO 2/2009, 12).
The fees are payable within 1 month of the filinq date, R45(2) EPC and GL
A-ill
However, if not paid the EPO will send an invitation to pay the fee in a
period of 1 further month, R45(2) EPC_
In practice, the EPO will not be able to send this invitation until they have
received the certified copy of the previous application under R40(3) (GL A-
Ill
No unnecessary payments are incurred by paying in response to the
R45(2) invitatiom
No action needs to be takem
If no fees are paid in response to the R45(2) invitation, the EPO will deem
claims 16-25 to be abandoned, R45(3) EPC_
It is not, anyway, possible to amend the claims at this stage, R137(1) EPC
Re-introduction of the claims should be possible provided thev have basis
in the description, i.e. provided their addition would not contravene A123(2)
EPC (J15/88Y
Thus, the deemed abandonment will only have a substantive effect and
prevent reintroduction of the claims if the relevant subject-matter was only
present in the original, deemed abandoned claims (Jl 5/88, GL A-III 9).
If the claims can validlx be introduced later on, then claims fees for each
claim above the 15 would become payable under R71(6) when
responding to a notification under R71 (3) proposing a text for grant.
Thus, if no fees were paid on filing or in response to a R45(2) invitation,
and then claims 16-25 were later reintroduced such that the allowable
claim set has 25 claims, then ten clams fees will become payable
(=€2000)_
The Communication from the Opposition Division will be deemed notified on the
tenth day following its posting, R126(2) EPC, i.e. on 5/1/09 + 10 days = Friday
15/1/09.
