The 4 month period for response thus expires on
15/1/09 + 4m - 15/5/09 (Saturday),
extended to 17/5/09 (Monday) under R134(1) EPC
The period had not therefore expired when T provided evidence of having
initiated entitlement proceedings, or when the proceedings were stayed as from
8/5/09.
The staying is in accordance with R78(1) EPC, which provides that R14(2)-(4)
EPC apply mutatis mutandis
Under RI 4(4) EPC the time not elapsed on a stayed period runs from the date on
which proceedings are resumed, but the time to run must be not less than 2
months.
In accordance with the calculation procedure set out in GL D-VII 5.3, there were
clearly less than 2 months left to run when the proceedings were stayed (in fact,
significantly less than 1 month was left).
Therefore, the period will be two months after the date of resumption on 4/1/10,
4/1/10 +2m 4/3/10 (R131(4) EPC)_
