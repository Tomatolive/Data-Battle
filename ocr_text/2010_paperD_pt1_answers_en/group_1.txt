The last request mav be accepted.
The extent of the opposition is defined by the notice of notice of opposition filed
under Agg EPC/R76(2) EPC - specifically R76(2) EPC
The notice of opposition must be filed within 9 months of publication of the
mention of grant A99(1 ) EPC_
Subject-matter not covered by the extent of opposition is QQ! subject to any
opposition in the sense of AIOI and nor are there any proceedings in the sense
of A114 and A115, (39/91 _
Thus, the attempt to extend the opposition to claim 2 will be rejected.
However, there may still be a chance of succeeding in getting the patent revoked.
In particular, it is only necessary for a single claim in the set of claims on file to be
found unallowable in order for that set of claims to be rejected in its entirety
(T926/93).
Thus, if claim 1 is found to lack novelty and/or inventive step then the patent will
be revoked (unless the patentee files auxiliary requests directed to a more limited
set of claims not sharing this deficiency).
In principle, the objection of lack of novelty against claim 1 should have been
made in the notice of opposition, GIO/91
However, the Opposition Division must nonetheless consider every ground
raised, including those raised only during the opposition proceedings, GIO/91
such new grounds are only to be admitted if they appear prima facie relevant,
GIO,'91_
Thus, the Opposition Division is required at least to consider the relevant of the
new ground of lack of novelty in relation to claim 1 _ if it is prima facie relevant and
on further examination correct, then the claims as granted will be rejected as a
whole (T926/93) on the basis of lack of novelty of claim 1
Alternatively, should the Opposition division either not admit the lack of novelty
attack as not bang prima facie relevant QL not being found correct, then the
clams as granted could still be rejected as a whole on the basis of the lack of
inventive step attack put fonvard in the original notice of opposition.

Protection can be obtained only for the football made of 33 patches of PX_
A divisional application can only be filed in respect of subject-matter that does not
extend beyond the content of the earlier applications as filed (A76(1 )EPC) and
while the earlier application is pending (R36(1))_
DIV-I was thus validly filed as its subject-matter was completely contained in EP-
1 and it was filed before EP-I was withdrawn, i.e. while EP-I was pending.
DIV-2 however currently does not fulfil the requirements of A76(1) EPC, because
it discloses the stitching method whereas the earlier application, DIV-I , does not.
Note that the requirements of A76(1) must be assessed in relation to the
disclosure of DIV-I not EP-I as DIV-2 is a divisional of DIV-I (GI /05). It would in
fact not have been possible to file DIV-2 as a divisional of EP-I since EP-I was
already withdrawn (i.e. fails the R36(1) requirement).
