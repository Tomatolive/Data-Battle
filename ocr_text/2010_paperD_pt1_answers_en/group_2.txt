It is allowable to remove the unallowable subject-matter (the stitching method)
from DIV-2 and still to retain divisional status, GI/05_ it is not relevant that DIV-I
is no longer pending, GI /05_
The disclosure relating to the stitching method will thus need to be deleted from
DIV-2 by amendment under A123/R137(2) after receipt of the European Search
Repon
It does not appear possible to claim a football having a number of patches other
than 33.
The claim includes the number 33 as a technical feature and in order to delete
this feature direct and unambiguous basis for the amendment is needed
(A123(2), GI/93, GL c-VI 5.31).
In the case of deletion of a feature from a claim, it would be necessary to show
that:
(a) the feature was not explained as essential in the disclosure,
(b) it is not, as such, indispensable for the functions of the invention in the light of
the technical problem it serves to solve, and
(c) the removal requires no real modification of other features to compensate for
the change.
(GL c-VI 5_3_ 10; T331/87)_
In this case, removal of the "33 patches" feature appears to contravene at least
the above requirements (a) and (b) and as such it would be unallowable under
A123(2)_
It may be possible to file a new application directed to footballs having other than
33 patches. This would of course depend on factors such as whether priority
could still be claimed from any of EP-I, DIV-I, DIV-2, whether any of these
applicants have been published, whether an inventive step exists in relation to
other numbers of patches, and so on.

a) No.
The conditions for an effect of a priority claim under the PCT are subject to A4 of
the Paris Convention (A8(2)(a) PCT)_
The priority period is fixed at 12 months for patents (and utility models),
A4C(1) PC.
The priority period therefore ran to 27/2/09 +12 m = Saturday 27/2/10, which is
extended to Monday, 1/3/10 under R80_5 PCT.
The filing date of 2/3/10 is therefore outside the priority period, and the priority
clam is invalid.
Under A48(1) PCT and R82(1)(a) PCT it may be possible to excuse missed time
limits due to mail irregularities, provided the relevant document or letter was
mailed at least 5 days prior to the expiration of the period, R82(1 )(a) PCT.
In this case, the mailing date of 25/2/10 is only 4 days prior to the expiry of the
period (1/3/10): hence A48(1 )/R82 PCT does not apply.
The applicant could seek to make use of the PCT provisions on restoration of
priority for PCT-X, R26bis3 PCT, R49ter PCT
