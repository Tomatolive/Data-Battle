Question 6
(5 points)
In response to a communication under Article 96(2) EPC, you, as the representative, request in
due time a nvo-month extension of the time limit given in the communication on the grounds
that the applicant is on a round-the-world sailing trip and is unable to give you any instructions
on how to reply to the communication. This time limit extension is granted by the EPO_ One day
before the extended time limit is due to expire, you notice that the applicant has not yet
retumed from his trip, and you request a further two-month extension. The EPO refuses this
request. You receive a communication under Rule 69(1) EPC dated 21 February 2006 due to
failure to reply to the communication under Article 96(2) EPC On returning from his sailing trip
on 3 March 2006, the applicant considers that the refusal to extend the time limit was not
justified and insists on presenting his case before the boards of appeal.
