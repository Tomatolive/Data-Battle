I do not therefore think that Mr Bad will be able to stop you marketing your
panels. At best, he may get narrow claims to the specific disclosed panels,
but you would presumably be able to avoid these claims.
What is more of a problem for you is the prior art effect of the two
embodiments in EPB, which I noted above were relevant to claims 3 and 4 of
PCTI as filed. Mr Bad has offered to "withdraw the conflicting embodiments
for the three countries (DE, FR, IT)". However, this does not make sense, as
there is no basis for doing this under the EPC Perhaps he means not pursue
EPC at all in these states, by not paying the designation fees (which should
be due this month, March, i.e. 6 months from an estimates publication date
(with search report for directâ€”EP with no priority claim) of October 2005
& EPCa.93(1 Given that these are such important states, I
doubt Mr Bad will want to do this. Moreover, as you are now intending to
pursue Euro-PCTI in other designated states, he would have to not pay
designation fees for all these states to remove the prior art effect of EPB
under and (4) &
If he is happy to do this, then good. However, a better approach would be to
establish that the two embodiments in EPB with undulating walls did arise
there as a result of Mr Ugly disclosing them in breach of confidence. This
would remove EPB from the state of the art under EPCa.55(1 )(a), as it would
then have been published within 6 months before the filing date of PCTI (i.e.
October 2005 is after 01.10_2004)_ At the moment, there is little evidence that
this is the case, and Mr Bad is right to say we would have difficulty proving
this.
There certainly seems no point in bringing entitlement proceedings for this
aspect of EPB when you would only end up with the narrow
subject matter disclosed above in the event (not at all guaranteed) that you
were successful
