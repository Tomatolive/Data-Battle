The disclosure of Dl on 15.092004 is also comprised in the state of the art
under EPCa.54(2), but as this does not disclose panels greater than 1m in
length (the example), the feature >3m in length should establish novelty (even
if this was regarded as a "sub-range" of the unspecified size limits of Dl, I
believe the invention would be regarded as a selection invention under
T279/89 and C-IV, T7(ii) because the sub-range is narrow vis-ä-vis the
undefined range in Dl, it is far removed from the example in Dl (1m) and
there is a technical effect — improved thermal efficiency — associated with the
new range).
However, EPB would be comprised within the state of the art under
EPCa.54(3) and (4) for all states in common, because it was filed earlier than
the effective filing dated of claim 4 (April 2004 vs. and publish
under EPCa.93 after (publication would have been around October 2005).
The specific example of a solar panel of 4m and 20 undulations/metre would
destroy the novelty of claim 4.
It this happens (i.e. if the designation fees are paid such that there is a
problem), then claim 4 could be easily amended to establish novelty. As EPB
is a 54(3) document, the specific example could be disclaimed (GI/03 and
G2/03). Alternatively, as EPB does not attach any explanation (i.e. purpose or
effect) to the undulations, claim 4 could be converted into a "use" claim as
discussed above. However, this should not be necessary.
Claim 5
Claim 5 is directed towards the extrusion process, as disclosed in Fl, filed on
01.10_2003_ PCTI validly claims priority from this application
so the effective filing date of this subject matter is 01.10.2003 (EPCa.89)_ The
only earlier disclosure that we know about is the Symposium of 2002, as
evidenced in the publication of 2004.
