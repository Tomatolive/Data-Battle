This withdrawal has the effect that any time limit not already expired (which in
this case includes the 30 month period for entry into the national phase under
PCTa.22(1), which is Monday 3rd April 2006, as explained above) is re-
calculated as the basis of the next earliest priority date
This would mean that the new due date for national phase entry under
PCTa.22(1) would be 30 months from the filing date of Dl
therefore Friday 15th September 2006. This is well after the time you expect
to have decisions from the inventors (June).
For the avoidance of any doubt, withdrawing the first priority claim in this way
could not effect the priority claim in the Euro-PCTI, because this has already
been entered into the European regional phase (PCTr.90bis_6).
By developing national phase entry in this way, no surcharges would be due
for late entry outside Europe. However, as the effective filing date the subject
matter in Fl would become the actual filing date of PCTI (01 10.2004), you
should bear in mind that it would face the publication of Dl as full prior art,
rendering the proposed use claim (see above) lacking in novelty. The
proposed process claim should not be effected.
