Candidates' answer
Dear Mr. Good,
Thank you for your letters of X March 2006. I have considered the matters
you have discussed and can advise you with respect to your specific
questions as follows.
Claims 1 to 5 of Euro-PCTI
Claim 1
Claim 1 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls. This subject
matter was first disclosed in your Fl patent application (filed on 01.10_2003),
from which PCTI validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G2/98). The effective
filing date of this subject matter in PCTI is therefore 01.10.2003 (EPCa.89).
The only disclosure of solar panels with undulating walls before this dare is
apparently the Tokyo Symposium held in 2002. Prior use of this nature is part
of the state of the art under
In order for alleged prior use to be novelty-destroying, it must be clear when,
what and under which conditions the disclosure took place (D-V, 31.2). As
the publication of the Symposium of May 2004, although not itself prior art,
what appear to substantiate these facts, the disclosure of the use of
undulating walls in 2002 would appear to destroy novelty of claim Indeed, if
the prior use was in fact an oral disclosure, the post published written version
is assumed to be a true account of the disclosure (D-lV, 5.1, last sentence),
and there does not appear to be any reason to dispute this.
