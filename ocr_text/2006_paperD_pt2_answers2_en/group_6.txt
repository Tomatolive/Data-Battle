However, this does not appear to mention any methods for making the
undulating panels, so claim 5 is certainly novel (EPCa54)_ There is no
suggestion that the process is obvious (EPCa_56(1)), but I would confirm this
with client
Forgot to say that a translation of ITI into French, German or English
(EPCa_ 14(1)) will need to be filed before the end of the period set for
responding to any EPCa51(4) communication received on Euro-PCTI to
maintain the priority date (EPCr_38(5))_ However, as there are no intervening
disclosures between 2209.2004 and 01 102004 (filing dates of ITI and PCTI
respectively), this is not so relevant).
In summary therefore, you should be able to obtain the following claims from
Euro-PCTI :
(iii)
Use of undulating walls in solar panels to increase thermal
efficiency.
Solar panels with undulating walls with 15-30 undulations/metre
and >3m in length (possibly with 4 metre and
undulations/metre disclaimed); and
Extrusion process.
20
1m
May also yet get claim to panels with undulations in 5-16 Wrn range,
length depending on basis.
Extension of Euro-PCTI
Euro-PCTI was entered into the European regional phase earlv in November
2005. The due date for paying designation fees under EPCa_ 79(2) is 6
months from mention of the publication of the search report, which is the date
of publication of the international search report under EPCa.157(1)_
-6
