As EPB discloses an example solar panel of 2 metres with undulations of 10
U/m, this will also be novelty destroying for claim 3, provided the designation
fees are paid.
There does not appear to be much scope for amending claim 3 to render it
allowable. We are not told what basis there may be in the application as filed
(EPCa_ 123(2)) to get around the publication of Dl_ Given that Dl is directed
towards the same technical effect, and discloses a panel size in the less than
3m range, it is hard to see how any amendment to sub-ranges of panel size
would be inventive anyway (EPCa_56). Claim 3 therefore appears invalid, and
should be deleted.
CLAIM 4
Claim 4 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls with 15-30
undulations per metre (U/m) and being more than 3m in length. This subject
matter was first disclosed in the Italian patent application ITI (filed
22.092004), from which PCTI validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G 2/98).
The effective filing dare of this subject matter is therefore 22.002004.
Once again, the two Tokyo disclosures of 2002 and 2004 are part of the state
of the art under EPCa.54(2)_ However, as they do not disclose a solar panel
of greater than 3m in length (the example is 1m), they will not be novelty
destroying. Moreover, the subject matter of claim 4 would be inventive over
these disclosures (EPCa56), because they relate to mechanical strenqth, and
are nothing to do with improved thermal efficiency.
