The only possible amendment to overcome this would be to incorporate the
limitation that the panel must be less than 3m. However, as this would arrive
at claim 3 anyway, there is no need to do this. Perhaps restrict to the
exemplified (1m) panels in this range, if there is basis (EPCa.123(2)).
Claim 3
Claim 3 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16
undulations per metre (U/m) and being less than 3 metres in length). This
subject matter was first disclosed in the Italian patent application ITI (filed
22.092004), from which PCTI validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G 2/98).
The effective filing date of this subject matter is therefore 2209.2004
In this regard, I am not concerned that Dl would be regarded as the "first
application" for this subject matter (which would invalidate the priority claim to
ITI (EPCa_87(1) + EPCa87(4)) merely because of the Example in that
document falling within the scope of claim 3, because the test for priority
entitlement is not the same as the test for novelty in this situation (G 2/98).
The disclosures that pre-date the effective filing date of claim 3 (2209.2004)
are the Tokyo Symposium Disclosure of 2002 and the corresponding
publication of May 2004 (EPCa.54(2)). However, these would not be novelty-
destroying as the 5-16 IJ/m feature is not disclosed (the example has 20 U/m).
Dl was also made available to the public before (on 1509.2004)
and is therefore also comprised in the state of the art under EPCa.54(2).
Unfortunately, Dl discloses embodiments wherein the panel of 1m having
undulating walls with the 5-16 U/m range. This falls within the scope of claim
3, such that it lacks novelty (EPCa.54(2)). This claim is therefore invalid.
EPB will be comprised in the state if the art for claim 3 under EPCa54(3) and
(4) for all designated states for which fees are paid (EPCr_23d).
