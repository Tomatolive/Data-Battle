Thus, claim 1 would appear to lack novelty. However, on the basis of the
published article, the only disclosure in 2002 was of the use of undulating
walls to mechanicallv strengthen the panels. It may therefore be possible to
reformulate claim 1 as a 'use' claim (C-lll, 4.9), directed towards the use of
undulating walls to increase the thermal efficiencv of the panel. As this use
was not disclosed in 2002, and as you are aware of no other disclosure, such
an amendment should render claim 1 patentable, as there was no suggestion
that this technical would be achieved (EPCa_54 & EPCa.56)_
Claim 2
Claim 2 is directed towards solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16
undulations per metre. This subject matter was first disclosed in the utility
model application Dl (filed on 1503.2004), from which PCTI validly clams
priority (EPCa.87(1)) (utility models explicitly mentioned), G2/98). The
effective filing date of this subject matter is therefore 1503.2004 (EPCa.89)_
Again, the Tokyo disclosure of 2002 is comprised in the states of the art under
EPCa.54(2). However, as there is no disclosure of panels having undulations
of 5-16 per metre (the only example has 20 undulations per metre), this claim
is novel (EPCa_54). There are no other possible disclosures before the
1513.2004 date.
Despite this, I am not confident that claim 2 would be considered inventive
(EPCa_56). This is because the technical effect achieved by having 5-16
undulation per metre is dependent on the size of the panel. Your Italian
laboratory says that the panel must be less than 3 metres long for the "better
results" to be seem As claim 2 is not limited to panels of this size, the
advantage is not present across the entire scope of the claim, and it is
therefore objectionable for lack of inventive step (EPCa_56) in light of the
Tokyo 2002 disclosure (T 939/92 "Agrevo"). I therefore think that claim 2 is
invalid.
