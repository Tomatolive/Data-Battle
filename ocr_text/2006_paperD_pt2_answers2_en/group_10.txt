In this way, it should be possible to stop Mr Bad marketing his panel in those
states where Euro-PCTI is designated and subsequently validated, including
back-damages for his infringement of the claims as published in PCTI _
Can Mr Bad stoo vou from marketinq the panels?
The only rights that Mr Bad can obtain to stop you are those he can obtain
from EPB, as you say there are no equivalents elsewhere.
You say the claim in EPB is to a 'new structure for the superimposed parallel
sheets'. Unless you are using this structure in your panels, then you will not
be infringing EPB and Mr Bad will not be able to stop you on the basis of this
claim.
There is the possibility of Mr Bad adding claims to EPB based on the
examples showing panels with undulating walls. It is unlikely that Mr Bad
would be able to qeneralise these examples to brad clams covering the
undulating wall invention oer se. This is because the examples are limited to
panels with undulations of 10 Ulm and 20 U/m, 2m and 4m respectively. It is
not generally possible to base claims on isolated features (T 938/95,
Tl 110/97 & T1067/97) (EPCa.123(2)).
Therefore, at best, Mr Bad may be able to obtain claims to the specific panels
disclosed in EPB_
Whether these claims would be inventive in light of the disclosure of panels of
1 m with 20 Ulm undulations in the Tokyo 2002 disclosure (which would be
prior art in the same way as it is for PCTI) is debatavle, particularly as EPB
gives no explanation of the undulations (EPCa_56).
