This publication takes the place of publication of Euro-PCTI (EPCa 158(1)),
from which time provisional protection under EPCa67(1) will have started for
those states where the language of PCTI is an official language
(EPCa_ 167(3) and Nat Law Table IIIA).
By selling panels with undulating walls, Mr Bad is infringing claim 1 as filed
and published. Moreover, by selling panels with walls with 10 Ulm and 20
Ulm he will be infringing claim 2 as published and possibly claim 3 as
published (if the 10 U/m one is <3m) & claim 4 as published (if the 20 U/m one
is longer than 3m). This provisional protection is limited to scope of the
eventually granted claims (EPCa69(2)), to his infringement of claims 2 and 3
(which I do not think will be granted) will be irrelevant. However, he would still
be infringing claim 1 in its proposed "use" format (although some states may
require him to be advertising the "purpose" of the undulations) and claim 4
(unless he falls within the scope of any disclaimers).
On this basis, Mr Bad will be infringing your patent as published and granted,
so you will be able to stop him. However, this protection will be limited to the
states that are designated in PCT-EPI and where the eventual patent is
validated (EPCa.64(1) and EPCa.65)_
In those states, you should file
translations of the claims as published, if needed, to secure provisional
protection
As most states will not allow you to take action until Euro-PCTI is granted
(see Nat Law Table IIIA, column 2), you should request accelerated
prosecution of Euro-PCTI (C-VI, 1.12; OJ 2001, 459) and accelerated grant
to ensure quick grant
In the meantime, you should provide Mr Bad with a copy of the claims to
ensure that he cannot rely on any 'innocent infringer' defences.
