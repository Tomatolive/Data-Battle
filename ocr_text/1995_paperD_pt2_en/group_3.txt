Note to candidates:
For this question. assume the date today is 13 April 1995.
On 13 April 1995. you receive the following information from a client:
(A) My company, BRIGHTCO, is a small. high-technology manufacturer of opto-electronic
devices based in Britain. Recently, we signed a collaboration agreement with a British
optical fibre manufacturer, GLAZECO. This agreement gives BRIGHTCO the option to
acquire the rights to any invention of opto-electronic devices developed by GLAZECO
Last year, GLAZECO developed a new method for incorporating various chemical dopants
(additives) in glass for producing improved optical fibres.
On 14 April 1994, GLAZECO filed a European patent application, EP(I), which specifi-
cally described the details of this doping method. Research director KAPPA was named as
inventor, I ) included claims to the doping method, to the doped glass and the improved
optical fibre.
From experiments using the dopants, GLAZECO found that the improved optical fibre
made with the doped glass exhibited enhanced optical properties, enabling the production
Of novel devices using such fibre. EP(I) included a general description Of the principles Of
a device in which such doped fibre might be used, but without any detailed specific
description of the features of such a device. The general description in EP(I) would clearly
have been sufficient for any experts in the field (such as BRIGHTCO) to develop such a
device themselves, given a reasonable amount of experimentation.
However, On 21 April 1994, GLAZECO filed a second European patent application, EP(2),
including the same description of the doping method as in EP(I), but with additional
detailed descriptions of two devices, X and Y, made using the improved optical fibre. EP(2)
included broad claims to opto-electronic devices incorporating the improved optical fibre
and dependent claims to devices X and Y. KAPPA and a GLAZECO research engineer,
LXMDA, were named as the inventors in this application. GLAZECO only paid filing and
search fees for both applications EP(I) and EP(2).
The details of the doping method and devices, exactly as described in EP(I) and EP(2)
respectively, were disclosed by the inventors in two scientific papers which they presented
at a conference on 24 June, 1994
In accordance with our collaboration agreement we intend to acquire the rights to EP(2),
but as we are not interested in manufacturing the optical fibre ourselves GLAZECO will
keep its rights to EP(I). GLAZECO has instructed its own agents to file a new application
claiming priority from EP(I) and adding the developments its research team has made to
the doping method over the last year. GLAZECO has assured me that the outline
description Of the principles Of the device which was included in EP(I) will be omitted
completely from the new application.
