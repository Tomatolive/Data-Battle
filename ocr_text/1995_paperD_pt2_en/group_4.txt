to expand our sales to the US, Australia and Japan, but we wish to minimise Our
expenditure on protection at least for the next year.
The GLAZECO researchers, including KAPPA and LAMBDA, are presently away in Japan
visiting another Optical fibre manufacturer. They will be back in a fortnight's time.
GLAZECO's lawyer has already prepared a draft assignment Of EP(2) for signature by
KAPPA, who alone is authorised to sign on behalf of GLAZECO, and by me the
managing director Of BRIGHTCO This will be completed on KAPPA's return.
We wish to protect some improvements made by our own technician, NEWMAN, to the
devices X and Y as originally disclosed in EP(2). NEWMAN has found that, for
commercial devices, more stable performance is achieved by using a known type Of
polarisation- sensitive fibre together with the doped fibre in the devices. This combination
reduces polarisation instabilities which NEWMAN discovered could occur when the doped
fibre was used alone. This disadvantage was unexpected, and has not previously been
reported in the literature as far as we know, but once NEWMAN became aware of it the
solution was relatively simple.
NEWMAN has just concluded the work on this and will be writing it up over this
weekend. I will have it sent to you by special delivery as soon as it is typed up next week
This should give you time to include it in the new filing and still be able to benefit from
the priority Of EP(2).
TO enable you to complete the necessary formalities GLAZECO says you will need to have
a copy Of EP(2) and a Power of Attorney from BRIGHTCO. I enclose a photocopy of
EP(2) and a Power Of Attorney signed by me to give you authority to represent
BRIGHTCO in patent matters, together with a copy of the search report from the EPO on
EP(2). I also enclose various patent and Other publications which the inventors came
across during their own literature searches
I believe that you can fax the new application and any of these other documents you need
direct to the EPO at the last minute if necessary and that the application at the EPO can
be extended to cover the other non-European countries Of future interest to us.
One of the background patents the inventors found is a US patent, USPI, which was
granted in the name Of one Of Our US competitors. FLASHCO. USPI was filed on 21
September 1993 and was published on 15 December 1994.
USPI describes and claims another method (different from that disclosed in EP(I for
doping glass to produce optical fibres with the dopants also used in the EP(I) method.
Optical fibres produced by FLASHCO's method would be indistinguishable from optical
fibres produced by GLAZECOs method. There is no reference in USPI to making devices
which might use the FLASHCO fibre.
FLASHCO reported its work and demonstrated a device using its fibre at an Opto-
electronics trade fair in the USA from 9 - 12 May 1994. FLASHCO's salesman had a draft
data sheet for the device which showed how the device was constructed and which he used
to explain the device to potential customers. As it was only a draft he wouldn't let people
have a copy for themselves then, but the device appears to have been identical to our
device X. Officially, FLASHCO only released the final data sheet at the conference Of
24 June 1994, when KAPPA was given a copy.
