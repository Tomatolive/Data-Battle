Following the recent announcement of our collaboration with GLAZECO and our intention
to produce devices X and Y, FLASHCO has now sent us a copy Of a PCT application,
PCT(F), wh,ch it has filed at the USPTO
FLASHCO has told us BRIGHTCO will need a licence under this application. FLASHCO
has also sent a copy Of the PCT Request form to support its claim to be extending its rights
to cover Europe. The PCT Request form shows that FLASHCO is applying for a regional
patent in Europe, and also for a "Continuation-in-Partn (CIP) in the US with reference to
USPI as the parent application. USPI is also cited as the only priority application. PCT(F)
was itself filed on 19 May 1994.
The description in PCT(F) is the same as USPI , except that details have been added Of a
device, using the doped fibre. which is exactly the same as the device FLASHCO
demonstrated at the trade fair PCT(F) only includes claims to FLASHCO's method and to
this device.
FLASHCO has told us that because PCT(F) will be examined by the USPTO for
international purposes, FLASHCO is confident that PCT(F) will be considered as allowable
internationally, because the USPTO has already granted USPI without any problem.
GLAZECOs lawyer has told me that as FLASHCO has filed under the PCT then PCT(F)
should now be published and that future proceedings will be open to public inspection I
understand that you can check FLASHCO's assertion that PCT(F) will be internationally
examined at the USPTO If so, please order a copy of any examination report issued by the
USyr() as soon as possible.
We want to be able to stop FLASHCO getting a patent anywhere for its device as early as
we can. We will want to intervene to give evidence to, or file comments with. the USIYrO
about the disclosures at the trade fair if the USPTO Examiner doesn't know about them.
