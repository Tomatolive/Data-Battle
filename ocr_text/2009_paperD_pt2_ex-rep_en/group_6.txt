Signing the application and entrusting the sealed envelope to a trusted and reliable
employee may constitute due care, and payment of the fees could support an argument of
due care, but if due care is not found, this can be argued at national phase, and
unintentional error may be argued at national phase before those countries that permit this
standard [PCT Rule 49ter.2]_
USA have filed a waiver to reinstatement [PCT Rule 49.1 ter(g)] and so restoration of
priority wth respect to USA [and other countries with waivers] is not possible, but for USA
a 1 year grace period applies and so it is possible to patent slugbanite-B and the method
of preparing slugbanites in USA.
In any case it would be wise to try and keep GB2 alive until it is clear that the priority
restoration has been allowed.
Strateqv with Biq Farma (8.5 marks)
Big-Farma have the superior position so far as the use against slugs and snails of
compositions comprising organo-copper compounds (e.g. escargines) and adhesives. Big-
Farma can prevent Silybum using these compounds regardless of any patents Silybum
has or may get. Owning a patent does not give the right to use the patented technology.
The claims of PCT-BF appear to be novel and probably inventive over the fact that
escargines are known compounds, particularly as you have got EPI and EP3 granted. It
would make sense to monitor PCT-BF for issuance of the search report
Silybum do not need to use escargines in their compositions and so if Big Farma are
aggressive Silybum can stop using escargines and still have a working product
Silybum have the superior position so far as slugbanites are concerned [even with the
deficiencies in their patents and applications] and can stop Big-Farma using slugbanites
alone or in combination against slugs and snails in the EPC-states including the extended
states.
Silybum can also stop Big-Farma from coating pots with compounds containing escargines
in bands between 1/4-3/4 pot height and/or containing attractants regardless of PCT-BF
Big-Farma do not need to use slugbanites and do not need to apply their compound
(escargines) only in bands benveen 1/4-3/4 pot height and do not need to add attractants.
Big Farma have a plant in Albania and Silybum can get protection there because
extension fees were paid for EPI-3 which can still be validated there.
Slugbanites and escargines used alone will effectively be competing products, but the
combined use of escargmes and slugbanites provides a product that is superior to either
alone.
If Big-Farma and Silybum co-operate, e.g. by cross-licensing, this would permit the earliest
and broadest introduction of slugbanites and escargines alone or in combination for slug
and snail control permitting each to produce products superior to those that either could
make in the absence of cooperation. This would also benefit the public in providing early
introduction of technically superior products into the market
