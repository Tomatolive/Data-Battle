Possible Solution - Paper D 2009 - Part II
Status of European patents and applications (8 marks)
Priority
One year from the filing date of GBI is 6th January 2008, which is a Sunday so the one
year term for validly claiming priority is extended to 7th Janua1Y 2008. EPI, EP2, and EP3
were all filed within this period.
GBI was filed without claims but has unambiguous disclosure (paragraphs in the
description) to support the claims of EPI, EP2 and EP3 and so the priority requirement of
"same invention" is met
GBI and EPI/EP2/EP3 have same applicant and so there is entitlement to claim priority.
There is no exhaustion of priority rightâ€” several applications may claim the same priority.
Therefore, the priority has been validly claimed for all claims in EPI , EP2 and EP3
Actions due
EPI and EP3 were granted ISt March 2009 so the three month term (in most countries) for
national validation expires ISt June 2009 (which may be extended as ISt June is a holiday
in some countries). For extension countries including Albania, which appears imponant in
the present circumstances, the same three month term expiring ISt June 2009 also
applies.
The London Agreement has the effect that for many countries a full translation is not
required.
For EP2 claims translations, grant and printing fees, and approval of text are due in EPO
in the next four months
Problems in applications (11 marks)
Prior art
Slugbanites and escargines are known but this does not appear to prejudice novelty or
inventive step of the subject matter of any of the claims of EPI , EP2 and EP3, since the
only earlier uses of these compounds and minerals are remote from deterring slugs and
snails. The deterrent effect was not known to exist for these compounds and minerals, but
only known for copper metal.
