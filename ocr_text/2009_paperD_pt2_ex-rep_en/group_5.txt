Recovering the PCT application (19.5 marks)
GB2 is the first filing for use of slugbanite-B as a slug killer and also for the new method of
preparing slugbanite. GB2 was filed before the publication of EPII EP2 and EP3.
Although EPI EP2 and EP3 disclose slugbanites in general there is no specific disclosure
of slugbanite-B, so a claim to use of slugbanite-B as a slug killer, or slug-killing
compositions comprising slugbanite-B, would be novel.
EPI , EP2 and EP3 would be Art 54(3) EPC prior aft to any Euro-PCT claming priority of
GB2. However, EPI , EP2, and EP3 would be Art 54(2) EPC prior art if priority is not
claimed. In the latter case, inventive step issues would arise as EPI , EP2, and EP3
disclose use of slugbanites in general to kill slugs.
It is therefore desirable to maintain the priority claim if explicit protection for slugbanite-B is
required from the PCT application. However, method claims to preparing finely divided
slugbanite may still be patentable even if priority is lost
12 months from the filing date of GB2 was 3rd January 2009, but as that is a Saturday, the
priority term is extended to 5th January 2009 [Rule 80.5 PCT]
There is still time to file a PCT application claiming priority of GB2 with a request for
restoration of the priority right, as the 2 month period (of PCT Rule 26.bis.3(a)) expires 5th
March 2009.
For restoration:
•
•
•
•
•
need to file application within the time limit for restoration (PCT Rule
and state reasons for failure to meet the time limit for filing the PCT application (PCT
Rule 26
a declaration or evidence in support of reasons for failure may be required (PCT Rule
but Silybum can file a declaration later (PCT Rule 26.bis.3(f)) [which could include the
original PCT application and envelope as evidence]
a fee for reinstatement is due [€550 RRF 213]
A PCT application needs claims for a filing date (PCT Art 11(1 You do not have a
copy of the PCT application, only of GB2 which did not have claims. Be sure that claims of
appropriate scope are in the application. You may need to deal with problems if the claims
in the envelope are different from the claims you file, or if there were no claims with the
PCT application.
The EPO will apply the standard that due care is required for restoration to be permitted
[PCT Rule
[Applying for restoration at 1B or UK IPO is a theoretical possibility to benefit from the more
generous "unintentional" error standard of PCT Rule but problems may result
since the original error was failure to file a PCT application using EPO as receiving office,
not using 1B or UK IPO].
