Examiners' Report Paper D 2009 Part II
This question, as in most years, presented the candidate with a client that knew enough to
get into trouble but needed help to survive. This year the candidate had the additional
problem that the client was going to be out of contact at a time when critical dates arose.
Candidates are supposed to accept the facts and the dates given. Candidates are
reminded that whereas there is no need to cite legal basis in part II, it can sometimes be
helpful in assisting their explanation.
The principal issues that the examiners were looking for were:
•
•
•
•
•
the existence of varieties of slugbanite that did not affect snails had an effect on the
validity of Silybum's patents and applications;
if priority could not be claimed for a PCT application corresponding to GB2i then EPI,
EP2, and EP3 were Art 54(2) prior art with resultant problems of inventive step;
there was still time to restore the claim to priority from GB2;
PCT-BF could be a problem for Silybum in Europe if it entered the European regional
phase, both because of the effect on Silybum's patents and on their freedom to market
their products;
Silybum and Big-Farma could both make products without infringing the other's
patents, but a better product could be introduced to the market if they cross-licensed.
The majority of candidates saw most of these issues. What differentiated the candidates
was how they dealt with the issues. Poorer candidates simply analysed the situation and
indicated problems: better candidates gave details of what to do to solve the problems.
The necessary analysis of the status of the client's patents and applications, and the
problems that they had, was generally adequate
On improvement of the patents, nearly all candidates realised that amendment in limitation
or opposition was possible to avoid covering escargines alone, or to deal with the non-
working forms of slugbanite. Fewer candidates recognised that if PCT-BF did not enter the
European regional phase, only the issue of the forms of slugbanite needed to be
considered.
On restoration of the priority right for the PCT application, most candidates saw the
solution, but relatively few analysed why it would be advantageous The different
requirements for a filing date for a PCT application as compared with an EP application
meant that many candidates did not realise they needed to file claims with the PCT
application.
The issue of strategy with Big-Farma caused difficulty to some candidates who only
considered the effect that Silybum's and Big-Farma's patents had on each others patents.
Those candidates who considered what each party was free to make despite the other's
patents, were generally able to provide a good solution.
