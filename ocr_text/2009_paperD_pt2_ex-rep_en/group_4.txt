The dependent claim of EP3 can be maintained as an independent claim without the need
for limitation to exclude escargines. It is not necessary to maintain unity in post-grant
amendment
For both EP3 and EPI post-grant limitation to slugbanite-A (rather than slugbanite in
general) is a possibility. Various amendments could be considered:
•
•
•
•
Limitation to slugbanite originating from the Hosta la Vista slugbanite mine is possible,
but could be too narrow for useful protection unless "equivalence" can be argued in
infringement proceedings.
Although slugbanite-A is not mentioned by name in the specification, if the skilled
person would know that Hosta la Vista produces only slugbanite-A this could be argued
to provide basis for a limitation to replace slugbanite by slugbamte-A, but this could be
objected to as adding subject matter.
Or post-grant limitation to slugbanite of the type obtainable from the Hosta la Vista
mine could achieve the desired result of protecting slugbanite-A (but might cause
clarity objections).
Or limitation to restrict to include slugbanites having the desired technical effect [killing
slugs and snails] could be better as potentially covering slugbamte-B as well as
slugbanite-Ai but this too might cause clarity objections.
The best amendment will depend on the wording of the description.
If opposition is filed while limitation is pending then the limitation proceedings are
terminated and fee is refunded (Rule 93(2) EPC)_
On EP2 Silybum could try filing amended claims and translations of amended claims and
inform EPO of the slugbanite issue and/or prior art.
Examination of EP2 can be re-opened even though the Rule 71 (3) EPC communication
has issued (GLX C-VIA_ 11) in view of the problem of lack of inventive step for non-working
forms of slugbanite, and the potential effect of PCT-BF for escargines_ If the Rule 71 (3)
EPC communication was the first one, amendment is permitted as of right and
examination must be re-opened.
It is unnecessary' to limit concerning escargines if PCT-BF is not regionalised However,
this regionalisation is due after the term for response to the Rule 71(3) EPC
communication. If PCT-BF is not regionalised before the due date it is possible to go into
further processing on the Rule 71(3) EPC communication.
If EP2 is granted before PCT-BF is regionalised then post-grant limitation of EP2 will still
be possible.
Broadened claims covering unclaimed aspects would be possible in EP2 or in divisional
application(s). For example, claims to the width of the band used in coating pots; methods
of deterring/killing slugs/snails; specific claims to combined use of escargnes and
slugbamtes to deter/kill slugs/snals_
