PCT-BF has the earliest priority date for deterring slugs and snails using compositions
comprising organo-copper compounds, including escargines, and adhesive. It also has the
earliest priority date for methods of treating pots with such compositions and treated pots.
PCT-BF will be Art 54(3) EPC prior art for EPII EP2, EP3 effective in all states, if it
enters the European regional phase. The 31 month period for PCT-BF expires 15th July
2009.
EPI , EP2, and EP3 all have claims covering combinations of organo-copper compounds
and adhesives.
EPI requires snail attractant and so the subject matter of the claim of EPI is novel over
PCT-BF
The EP2 claim, and the independent claim of EP3 do not require the presence of snail
attractant, and so lack novelty over PCT-BF because the claimed compositions cover
escargnes alone in combination with an adhesive.
The dependent claim of EP3 is novel as there is no disclosure in PCT-BF of applying the
snail deterrent compositions in a band between one quaffer to three quaners the height of
the plant pot.
Non-working embodiments
There is no reason to doubt inventive step concerning use of slugbanites to kill slugs and
snails for effective embodiments The general knowledge of these materials does not show
their effectiveness for this purpose.
However, even though a working embodiment is disclosed, not all slugbanites are effective
to achieve the goal of killing slugs and snails.
It could be argued that there is reason to doubt inventive step for the subject matter of the
claims of EPI EP2, and EP3 since two of the four varieties of slugbanite do not provide
the technical effect required. (Or it could be argued that sufficiency of disclosure is in doubt
for the same reason as 50% of the varieties of slugbanite do not work: this is not the same
as an occasional non-working embodiment which could be excused).
How can the patents and applications be improved? (13 marks)
EP3, and possibly EPI, are granted with potentially invalid claims but can be amended:
• if opposed, during opposition; the opposition period is still open expiring ISt December
2009;
• by post-grant limitation;
• in national revocation proceedings, or othemise if national law allows.
So, if PCT-BF enters European regional phase, apply to limit the independent claim of EP3
by excluding compositions containing escargines alone.
