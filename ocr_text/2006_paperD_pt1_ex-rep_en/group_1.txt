Examiners' Report Paper D Part 1 2006
It has been repeatedly reported that candidates are supposed to keep in mind that in Dl
their versatility and ther ability to apply the legal basis to specific situations is verified.
It has to be repeated again how important it is to cite the correct legal basis and to also
apply it to the specific question The mere citation of articles and rules leaves the examiner
in doubt whether the candidate has understood the underlying problem and cannot,
therefore, be considered as useful. Likewise, providing the correct answer without citing
the legal basis is rarely convincing.
In general, but especially when answering an open question (e.g. question 9) candidates
should keep in mind that they are expected to demonstrate their ability to identify the most
relevant issues of the specific situation given, and to provide solutions and advice to a
potential client, for all these issues in a complete, understandable and clear manner.
Candidates are expected to use the most recent updates of legal texts in order not to lose
marks.
Question 1 - It was overlooked by some candidates that the common representative was
HYPERTOOLS represented by its employee, Rule 26(3) EPC was cited by few
candidates. Nearly all candidates missed the point that representation before the EPO is
also an issue in the international phase.
Question 2 did not cause any problems to most candidates. It seems that EPO's practice
with regard to divisional applications is well known.
Question 3 - Rule 19.1 (b) PCT was not always mentioned and not all the possibilities
regarding languages and/or competent ISAs were identified.
For question 4 it was expected to mention that Rule 92bis_ 1 (a)(i) PCT only applies until
the expiration of 30 months from the priority date and that German is a language of
publication and can be used before the EPO Many candidates failed to mention that the
request must be received by the 1B within the 30 month term
Regarding question 5, most candidates did not realise that any loss of priority occurring
after publication does not affect the application of Art 54(3) EPC
Question 6 - Many candidates proposed the procedure of Rule 69(2) EPC
They overlooked that applying this procedure would not avoid the loss of the application.
Question 7 and question 8 were reasonably well answered.
Question 9 did not pose a serious problem to most candidates. It was required to explain
what happens if an applicant transmits an application to the EPO in Vienna although this is
not a filing office.
