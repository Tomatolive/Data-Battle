designated in EP2 (which are identical to the contracting states designated in EPI) for
which the designation fees have been paid, R 23a EPC_
EP2 claimed a priority of March 2002 as indicated on the publication of the application.
EP2 was published earlier than the date of filing of EPI
Any loss of EP2's priority right occurring after publication by not filing the copy of the
priority document does not affect the application of Article 54(3) EPC: see Guidelines C
or C-V,3.4.
Therefore, under Article 99 EPC an opposition against EPI based on Art. 100(a) EPC filed
until 02 November 2006 (01 November extended according to Rule 85(1) EPC) will be
successful.
