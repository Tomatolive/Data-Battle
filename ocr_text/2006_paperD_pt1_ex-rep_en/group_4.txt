Answer to question 6:
1. If the client insists on having the rejection of the requested extension of time limit
reviewed by a board of appeal, further processing must be requested and a refund of the
fee for further processing must be requested
The Rule 69 (1) communication is deemed to be delivered on 03.032006 (Rule 78(2)
EPC)_ The request for further processing must therefore be filed by
Within said time limit, the fee for further processing must be paid and the reply to the
communication must be filed.
The decision to refuse the requested refund could then be challenged with the decision
terminating the proceedings, Alt. 106(3) EPC, i.e. grant or refusal, or separately,
Guidelines E-Vlll, 1.6 and J37/89 (OJ 4/1993, 201).
2. No, a sailing trip is not a sufficiently exceptional circumstance for extension, Guidelines
E-Vlll,
Simply requesting further processing alone (Article 121 EPC) is cheaper and is guaranteed
to succeed.
Answer to question 7:
Yes, see legal advice No. 11/82, OJ 82, 57 (or Guidelines D-VI 2.2 or Guidelines D-VIII
1.2_5_ or Case Law Book VIII. or T 73/84 T 186/84 T 237/86, T 347/90, T 459/88).
According to paragraph 3 of the legal advice, the request for revocation implies that the
proprietor no longer approves the text as granted, Art 1 1 3(2) EPC_
Answer to question 8:
The opponent is allowed to file in Italian. According to Rule 6(2) EPC, the translation of the
notice of opposition required under Art. 14(4)EPC has to be filed within the longer of one
month after filing the notice (Rule 6(2), first sentence), i.e. 24.022006, or the nine-month
opposition period (Article 99(1 ) EPC), expiring on 2T012006. Thus, the period for filing
the translation expires on 24.022006.
The one month time limit runs from the day the fax is received (Rule 36 (5) EPC, Notice of
the President dated 06 December 04, OJ 1/2005,41, Guidelines A-IX, 2.5).
The translation was received at the EPO on 28.022006. This is too late.
Therefore, the opposition is deemed not to have been filed.
Answer to question 9:
The Vienna sub-office of the EPO is not a filing office in the sense of Alt. 75(1)a EPC
Therefore European patent applications cannot be filed there. See notice of the EPO of 06
December 2004 concerning the Vienna sub-office, OJ 1/2005, 44, Guidelines A-II, 1.1
Applications received at the Vienna sub-office will be transmitted to Munich or The Hague,
and their filing date is their date of receipt in Mumch or The Hague
Hence the filing date of EP-A is 06.032006, which is later than the 12-month period of
Article 87(1) EPC, which ended on 0303.2006.
The priority claim is therefore not valid, and the lecture is novelty destroying for EP-A
under Article 54(1) and (2) EPC. The lecture is not prior art against CZA
