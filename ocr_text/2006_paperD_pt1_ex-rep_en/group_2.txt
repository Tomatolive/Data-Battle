Possible Solution - Paper D- Part I
Answer to question 1
Yes. Both applicants have a place of business or residence in one of the contracting
states. Therefore, no professional representative is needed (Art 133(1 EPC)_
Thus, I can act before the EPO because I am an employee of the applicant
(A133(3) EPC).
Conditions to be fulfilled are that
I am authorised by HYPERTOOLS to act before the EPO
- and the authorisation or general authorisation has been filed with the EPO
See Rule EPC, or Decision of President 19 July 91, OJ 91 p_489, or GL A-IX 1.5.
Another condition to be fulfilled is that HYPER TOOLS is appointed as common
representative. HYPER TOOLS can be made the common representative either by explicit
statement in request for grant (R26(3) EPC), or as first named applicant (RI 00(1) EPC).
I can also act before the EPO for International Applications filed with the EPO as
Receiving Office by virtue of Article 49 PCT or Rule 90.1 (a) PCT and Article 133 (3) EPC
HYPERTOOLS is a common representative either by explicit statement,
Rule 90.2 (a) PCT, or as first named applicant, Rule 90.2 (b) PCT.
Answer to question 2:
i) Yes. A divisional application can only be filed in respect of a pending earlier European
Patent Application R25(1) EPC As the decision to refuse the application is suspended on
filing of the appeal, (Art 106(1) EPC), the application is considered to be pending.
See Guidelines A-y, 1.1.1 or J28/03, OJ 12/2005, or Notice of the EPO OJ 2002, pg. 112
ii) In this case the answer is no, because an appeal is deemed not to have been filed if the
fee is not paid. See A108 EPC (second sentence).
iii) Nc if an opposition against a patent has been filed, there is no pending application
(as required by R25(1) EPC).
