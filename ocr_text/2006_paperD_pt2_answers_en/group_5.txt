The disclosure in JP does not disclose any panel having the features of claim 4
(20 Ulm but 1 m long).
EPB is prior art under A54(3) for the same reasons discussed above in relation
to claim 3. EPB discloses a panel having 20 IJ/m and 4 m long, so falling within
the scope of claim 4 claim 4 is not novel (A54(1))_ It will be possible to
restore novelty by disclaiming this specific combination -5 such a disclaimer will
not be regarded as added matter under A123(2) following GI/03_
We should also consider the effects of Dl, which was published before the
effective date of claim 4. All embodiments disclosed in Dl correspond to panels
of 1 m of length, so none falls within the scope of our claim 4. However, claims
in Dl are not limited to any specific length and disclose thus any panel having
5-16 U/m_ The range claimed in claim 4 clearly overlaps with the range
disclosed in Dl _

Claim 4 is not novel since it includes the explicitly mentioned end-point of the
known range from Dl_ In order to restore novelty, it will not be sufficient to
exclude the specific novelty destroying value. It is necessary to consider
whether the skilled person would consider seriously to work in the range of
overlap; if he would do so, no novelty (T 26/85).
However, we have basis in the disclosure of IT, which according to what you
told me has all been included in the PCTI, to narrow the claim so as to avoid
overlap with the range disclosed in Dl .
