So until that date it is possible to validly pay the designation fees for CJK, BE
and any other country. I would suggest to pay 7 designation fees in total in view
of Bad's activities, since that will be deemed to cover designation fees for all
countries (RFees, 2.3). You can always later on withdraw a designation if you
so wish.

Wavs to postpone national phase ent√ü' for PCTI
One way to do this would be to withdraw the claim to priority from Fl. According
to the present situation for PCTI, national phases under A22 PCT must be
entered within 30 m from the earliest priority, i.e. by 1.04_06 (possibly extended
to 304.06 since 1.04_06 is a Saturday).
Under R90bis.3(a) PCT it is possible to withdraw a priority claim at any time
before expiration of 30 M from priority date. So we are on time to do this.
If there is more than 1 priority, as is the case here, the applicant can exercise
the right under in respect of one or more priority clams (R90bis.3b)_
Under any time limits computed from original priority and not yet
expired will be recalculated. If priority is withdrawn now, entry into national
phases under A22 or A39 will be delayed until 30 M from Dl (15.0304), i.e.
until This will allow you enough time to take decisions on the project,
which are expected by June.
