EPB has an earlier filing date (Apri104) and was published later (we
know it is published because the 18-M period for publication expired
October'05 and moreover you have detected said publication). Assuming
designation fees are paid for EPB, this will be prior art under 54(3) for the
assessment of novelty (A54(3)(4), R23a). By the way, this is irrespective
of the fact that eventually the common designations may be withdrawn in
EPB. Changes taking effect after the valid publication of the application
do not affect its status as prior art under A54(3) (see C-lV-6_ la).
EPB discloses a panel having 10 Ulm x 2 m long, i.e. a panel which falls
within the scope of our claim 3 *claim 3 is not novel over EPB_
According to GI/03, it would be possible to introduce a disclaimer to
restore novelty against this A54(3) disclosure (from what you have told
me I have understood that the structure of the panels in EPB is new and
different to yours but that there are 2 embodiments of panels such as
yours disclosed in EPB).
However, in addition to EPB, also Dl is prior art. Dl was published on
1509.04 and thus is full prior art under A54(2)_ Since Dl discloses
panels having 5-16 Ulm albeit of any length — but all examples disclosed
fall within the scope of claim 3 (all have 1 m of length), claim 3 is not
novel over the publication of Dl_ Moreover, Dl is also prior art relevant
for the assessment of inventive step. Claim 3 thus does not seem to be
valid.
CLAIM 4 — Solar panels having undulating walls with 15-30 Ulm and > 3 m
length
Such a combination of features is only disclosed for the first time in ITI and thus
according to G2/98, it is only entitled to that priority date (cannot be regarded as
the same invention disclosed in Fl or Dl)_
