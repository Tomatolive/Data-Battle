Paper Dll
Dear Sir,
After having studied the information that you provided to me, I would like to offer
you the following advice in relation to each of your questions.
1)
Validity of claims 1-5 in Euro-PCTI and wavs to improve them
PCTI was filed on 1.404 claiming priorities from Fl, Dl and IT 1 _ PCTI was
filed within 12 m of the earliest priority and so priority seems to be validly
claimed. In principle all requirements to validly enter the regional phase at the
EPO have been complied with and the application seems to be standing in good
order. Dealing now with each claim one by one, I can advise as follows:
CLAIM 1 - solar panels having undulating walls
This is disclosed for the first time in Fl. Since priority from Fl has been validly
claimed, this is entitled to 1.10_03 as effective date for the assessment of prior
art under A54(2) and (3) (A89 EPC). Unfortunately, there seems to be prior an
prior to this effective date. Under A54(2) EPC, the state of the art comprises
everything made available to the public by means of a written or oral disclosure.
According to your information, during the 2002 Tokyo Symposium on Solar
Panels the disclosure was made of the use of undulating walls to mechanically
strengthen the panels. Although the printed proceedings for this Symposium
were not made available until May'04, i.e. after the effective date of claim 1, the
disclosure during this public conference took place in 2002 and thus amounts to
prior art citeable against claim 1 under A54(2) EPC
