Actions aqainst Mr Bad â€” stop him?
As discussed under section 1) above we will be able to obtain in EuroPCT1
claims directed to:
a) panels with undulating walls (with disclaimer) (subject to convincing the
EPO that disclosure in JP is accidental)
b) claim 2 panels with 5-16 U/m
c) claim 4 panels with 17-30 U/m + >3 m long
If we enter national phases in other countries (US, JP), we will also be able to
obtain patents there. In the USA, by virtue of the grace period of 1 year, the
discloure of Dl will not be prior art against claims in PCTI entitled to the priority
of ITI since less than 1 year occurred between the two. We should check JP
legislation because also a grace period seems to exist there. Moreover, since
EPB was only filed in Europe, with no equivalent disclosures taking place
elsewhere, the effects of EPB as prior art as discussed above will be
constrained only to Europe, since its publication date (18 M from April'04, i.e.
around October05) is well after the filing date of PCTI
So in the USA Good will be able to obtain broader protection even than in
Europe, in panicular claim 3 and 4 as contained in PCTI
Once these patents are granted, Good will be able to stop Bad selling any solar
panel with undulating walls falling within the scope of their granted claims.
Since Bad is already offering panels and has in fact started selling at least in UK
and BE, I would strongly advise you to tty to speed up as much as possible
prosecution of EuroPCT1 under the PACE program (OJ 2001, 459). Under
A67(1), from the date of publication of an EP application, this already confers
provisional protection. In certain countries, a published application does not
confer the full effects provided under A64, only the right to claim for reasonable
compensation. Cenain countries require that claims be published in the
language of that state for that protection to become effective (A67(3)).
