As long as your panels do not fall within the scope of their granted claims, Bad
will not be able to stop you. It is irrelevant if there is disclosure of panels such
as yours in the description, that has only relevance with regard to the effects of
EPB as prior art against you. In such a case, at the most he could try to obtain
claims directed to the only two specific embodiments of panels with undulating
walls disclosed, 10 U/m x 2 m and 20 Ulm x 4 m. Those have as effective date
April'04. Though specifically these two panels have not been previously
disclosed in any prior art — the relevant prior art for them is the Tokyo
proceedings under A 54(2) and your EuroPCT1 under A54(3) for all commonly
designated states — it is very unprobable that he can get claims granted on
them since no effect is explained, so no technical teaching different over the
disclosure in Tokyo 2002 If he could get such claims, the effect would be that
while his patent would be dependent on yours since it has a later effective date,
you would not be able to sell such two panels without Mr Bad's permission. Of
course, as stated under 4), he will not be able to sell without your permissiom
So, in view of the fact that your EuroPCT1 is entitled at least to Fl and Dl
dates, which are earlier than EPB date, it is hardly possible that EPB can get
any blocking claims.
As to his offer to withdraw embodiments, this does not make much sense.
Under A54(3), as stated above, his application is prior art as from its valid
publication, whatever happens later to his application. So even if he would
delete those embodiments now, that would not change the effect of EPB as
prior art under A54(3) (see my discussion earlier on).
Your position seems to be pretty good, so no need to discuss any agreement
with him.
Only if contrary to my understanding explained above, his application EPB
would indeed contain claims that would potentially cover your intended acts, i.e.
the panels you wish to manufacture, should we then consider starting
discussions with him. In any event, because you have an earlier effective date
in EuroPCT1, you will be able to obtain broader protection (your application
would moreover be prior art under A54(3) against him for all validly common
designated states) and so will always be in a better position for negotiating.
