Unless we can provide sound reasons against the printed document being a
true account of what was said during the conference, it will be assumed that the
printed document reproduces the oral description (C-lV-5_1, D-V-3.3) and thus
the disclosure in the 2002 conference will be prior art Since in that article and
hence presumably in the conference panels having undulating walls and in
particular a panel 1 m long with walls having 20 undulations per metre (U/m)
was disclosed, claim 1 would not be novel (A54(1) EPC)_
Since apart from this single panel, no other disclosure appears to have been
made, we could try to regain novelty by amending claim 1 to exclude what has
been disclosed (the panel 1 m x 20 U/m).
The insertion of such a disclaimer, which is not contained in the application as
filed, will only be acceptable at the EPO following GI/03, i.e. will not be
regarded as being against A123(2), if it is used to restore novelty against an
accidental anticipation under A54(2)_ Moreover, according to this decision it is
necessary to remove no more than strictly necessary to restore novelty. Though
the disclosure in the Japanese symposium deals with solar panels, since it
deals with an uncompletely related problem to the one we attempt to solve
(mechanically strengthening panels versus improving thermal efficiency), we
may well be able to argue that the disclosure of a panel having undulating walls
with 1 m long and 20 IJ/m is an accidental disclosure.
I would therefore propose to amend claim 1 by inserting a disclaimer to exclude
this panel disclosed in 2002. Such a claim would then be novel. Since the
technical effect of these panels, i.e. their improved thermal efficiency, cannot at
all be derived from the prior art, I believe such a claim will be regarded as
inventive (A56) and hence as patentable â€” it is clear it has industrial application
under A57 too.
I would also suggest, in view of this prior art we have discussed, to insert a
claim directed to the use of undulating walls in solar panels to improve their
thermal efficiency.
Apart from the disclosure in the Tokyo Symposium, there is no other prior art.
