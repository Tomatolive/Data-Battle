Since in IT and thus PCTI we have included embodiments showing the
technical improvement over both claimed ranges (i.e. the one in claim 3 and
claim 4) for all integer values of undulations per metre, it would be possible to
amend claim 4 to direct it to panels having a range of 17-30 Ulm + > 3 m length.
Such a new claim will not be regarded as added matter under A123(2) (see
T201/83, also T925/98)_ Such a claim will not overlap with the disclosure in Dl
and thus should be regarded as novel. Moreover, since Dl discloses that in
order to obtain good results it was necessary that the number of undulations x
m was between 5 and 16, we will be able to argue that it was unexpected that
panels having ranges above that range prove to be also effective. So I believe
we will be able to argue that such a claim is inventive in addition to novel.
CLAIM 5 - Extrusion process
This was disclosed for the first time in Fl. Since there seems to be no prior art
before the effective date of Fl disclosing such a process, I believe such a claim
is valid, i.e. patentable.

Extension of EuroPCT1 to IJK'BE
Yes, it is still possible to designate UK and BE in EuroPCT1
EuroPCT1 was regionalized on Nov'05 and only DE, FR, IT were designated. I
assume you mean only the designation fees for these 3 countries were paid (or
the intention to pay for these 3 countries was indicated in the request for Entry
into regional phase). According to R107(1)(d), designation fees must be paid
within 31 months from the earliest priority date if the period under A79(2) (6 m
from publication of search report) has taken place earlier. Here regional phase
was entered much well before the 31 M time limit 31 M term ends: 1.10.03
[31 m] _05_06 closed 205.06 Tuesday.
