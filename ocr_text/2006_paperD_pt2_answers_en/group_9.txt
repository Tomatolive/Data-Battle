Since under A158(1) EPC publication of PCTI takes the place of publication of
the EP application, provisional protection under EuroPCT1 is already available.
We should check national requirements and file translations as required. Copy
of the application and probably translations should be submitted to the infringer,
Mr Bad.
Also in the USA and other countries we may be entitled to provisional
protection.
We should monitor the activities of Bad and if he is going to act in any other
market in addition to Europe I would recommend to enter national phases under
PCTI as soon as possible.

Can Bad stop us?
Bad has only EPB as potential right to use against us. So, he can't do anything
at all against us outside Europe.
As to EPB, from the information you had provided me, it would seem as if Bad
would have obtained information on your panels ilegally via your former
research manager, Mr Ugly. If that would be the case, it would be possible to try
to obtain title to EPB since an EP patent shall belong to the inventor or
successor in title and Mr Bad maybe is not the inventor.
In principle, proceedings could be started against him claiming entitlement to his
alleged invention and thereafter, once a final favourable decision was obtained,
claim the right to EPB under A61_ However, from what you have told me, it
seems it may be extremely difficult to prove such an allegation, so it seems we
do not have much chances here.
So, assuming he retains EPB, he may be able to obtain a patent for whatever
new is disclosed in his application. I am not sure to have fully understood the
contents of EPB from your comments. You say it claims a new structure for
superposed panels. It seems to me that this is different to your structure in your
panels. If this is so, you should not concern much about his patent.
