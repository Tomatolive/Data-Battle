CLAIM 2 — solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 Ulm
This invention is disclosed for the first time in the German utility model Dl.
Under G2/98, it cannot be regarded as the same invention as the panels
disclosed in Fl and thus cannot be entitled to that priority. Under A87(1 priority
can be claimed from utility models, so the German priority is valid.
There is no prior art before the effective date of this claim (153.04) disclosing
panels having undulating walls with 5-16 IJ/m. The Japanese symposium does
not destroy the novelty of such a claim since it disclosed only one panel having
20 Ulm *the claim is thus novel (there is no other prior art apart from this of an
earlier date). In addition, this claim can be regarded as inventive since the
disclosure in Tokyo does not at all anticipate that panels having wavy walls and
this range of undulations will exhibit improved thermal efficiency, this JP
disclosure dealing only with the mechanical strength of solar panels.
Claim 2 thus seems to be valid in the light of the prior art known to us.
CLAIM 3 — Solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 Ulm and < 3 m
length
Such a combination of features (5-16 1.11m) and length < 3 m cannot be
considered as directly and unambiguously derivable from the disclosure of Dl,
since Dl discloses panels having 5-16 Ulm but of any length (even if specific
examples all have 1 m of length ) *thus the criteria according to G2/98 for
validly claiming priority for the same invention are not fulfilled. The effective date
of claim 3 is thus the priority date of ITI , i.e. 2209.04.
The Tokyo Symposium does not disclose panels having 5-16 U/m and thus
does not destroy novelty of such a claim. However, in addition to that, there are
2 further pieces of prior art to consider:
