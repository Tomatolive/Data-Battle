In order to obtain the desired protection for COOLMIX and surfactants in general, an
EP application describing and claiming the desired combination should be filed. This
application should be filed before publication of NIPPON SAWS' CLEAN-PCT, which
will be around 0204.2002, in order to avoid that CLEAN-PCT becomes published prior
art relevant to novelty and inventive step. The claims should be directed to COOLM IX
and the specific surfactants from COOLMIX-EP, COOLMIX and surfactants in general,
and their use for cooling, cleaning wafers and removal of abraded material. The priority
claim should be based on SILWAFE's combination of COOLMIX and surfactants first
disclosed in COOLMIX-EP Of 27.11.2001. The priority claim is certainly valid for the
mixture of COOLMIX and the specific surfactants disclosed, but may, depending on the
quality of the disclosure, be valid for the generalization to COOLMIX and surfactants in
general, if this is the same invention in the sense Of G2/98.
In case that NIPPON SAWS CLEAN-PCT becomes relevant under Article 54 (3) EPC,
the particular surfactant disclosed therein could be excluded by a disclaimer.
COOLMIX-DE will probably not be relevant to the new COOLMIX-EP as earlier right in
Germany, since it describes only COOLMIX alone, without surfactants being admixed.
The question whether the information given by NIPPON SAWS conceming CLEAN-
PCT was confidential or not will only be relevant if the priority claim Of the new EP-
application is not fully valid.
Sincerely yours,
