Most candidates made reference to the general concept Of seeking a judgement that
the MULTISAW parts of CUT-PCT belongs to SILWAFE and open court proceedings
in case that Dr. BISSIG would not be cooperative. However, many candidates failed
to explain where and how court proceedings can be opened and very many also
failed to explain that the PCT does not provide for suitable regulations in this context
and that only a validly regionalised EURO PCT application can be controlled by
SILWAFE under the provisions of Article 61 EPC.
Few candidates explained in sufficient detail the actual possibilities to get in control Of
the MULTISAW technology in peaceful agreement with DR. BISSIG. This led to loss
Of points, since the paper specifically stresses as a last point that maintaining good
business relations is considered to be the preferred option. In particular, very few
candidates explained fully and convincingly the various possibilities of licence
agreements between the parties or SILWAFE entering as co-applicant for CUT-PCT
with possible later divisional applications after entering the regional phase in Europe.
Too few candidates suggested refiling the MULTISAW technology immediately, since
no disclosure to the public has been made so far. Only Listig has been informed
under secrecy conditions. CUT-PCT, if entering the European regional phase, would
not constitute prior art under Article 54(3) against such a refiled application due to
evident abuse in accordance with Article 55 EPC_ Too few suggested keeping
MULTISAW-DE alive to at least have earlier rights and patent protection in Germany.
Almost all candidates suggested seeking patent protection for the BLOW-SAW
technology, however, many failed to explain that specific claims should be directed to
the device, the process and also to the computer program. Mostly, it was realised that
the missing student is to be mentioned as inventor. However, not many fully explained
the possibilities Of solving this problem and the additional implications in the US.
Very many failed to correctly analyse and suggest the possibilities for obtaining the
best position with respect to the COOLMIX technology Some suggested filing new
claims in the COOLMIX-EP application, e.g. directed to the use for cooling. It was
also realised by some that a further new application could be filed immediately,
possibly with priority claim of COOLMIX-EP, containing tailor made claims and
information to take account of CLEAN-PCT, which for such a newly filed application
would only, at the most, be novelty relevant prior art under Article 54(3) EPC
