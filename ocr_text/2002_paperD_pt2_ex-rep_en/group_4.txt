PART
Dear Dr. Wichtig,
I refer to the meeting we had on 20.03.2002 and to the questions you raised in
connection with your planned meeting Of Wednesday next week with Dr. Bissig Of Zähnli
1.1
1.2
The patent situation Of the applications we had been talking about is as follows:
Regarding the MULTISAW process and device, the 29.112000 has been validly
established as the priority date by SILWAFE's patent application MULTISAW-DE.
The priority was validly claimed in the applications MULTISAW-US and
MULTISAW-JP. Consequently, SILWAFE's applications MULTISAW-DE,-US and -
JP are the earliest applications covering the MULTISAW technology in these
countries.
The situation is different for SILWAFE's European patent application MULTISAW-
EP where the wrong description, claims and drawings were erroneously filed
Unfortunately, the EPO will not allow correction of the error by substituting the
complete application documents by the correct ones, in accordance with the
Enlarged Board of Appeals' decision G 2/95. The correct priority document based
on MULTISAW-DE will be of no help, since the EPO does not allow priority
documents to be used for the purpose of correction of errors, see G 3/89.
Therefore we have to face the fact that our application MULTISAW-EP is lost.
There is, however, a further application wherein the MULTISAW technology is
covered for EP, namely, Zähnli's CUT-PCT which designates EP, JP and US and
has the filing date of 20.12.2000. Regarding the subject-matter described and
claimed in CUT-PCT, Zähnli has, if at all, only right to the special saw blades
described and claimed, which are apparently based on an invention of Mr. Listig
Mr. Listig's taking over of the MULTISAW part was certainly abusive, since the
circumstances of Mr. Klug's meeting with him on 06.12.2000 clearly indicate
confidentiality of the information concerning MULTISAW_ Therefore Mr. Listig is not
the inventor Of that subject-matter, and he has no right to the corresponding
European patent.
Hence what remains for SILWAFE in EP is that MULTISAW-DE, if published, will
be a national right of earlier date with respect to CUT-PCT's EP-part being relevant
in DE, but not in the further designated Contracting States.
Regarding MULTISAW-US and 4P, SILWAFE is in a good position since the filing
date Of CUT-PCT is later than the valid priority date Of these applications.
Turning now to SILWAFE's COOLMIX applications, it can be stated that for the
composition COOLMIX alone, the priority date 29-11-2000 was validly established
by the application COOLMIX-DE, and the priority was validly claimed by the
applications COOLMIX-US and -JP. Contrary to what happened in the MULTISAW
case, the application COOLMIX-EP contained the correct description, claims and
