SILWAFE should, in order to be prepared for every outcome of the meeting with
Dr. Bissig, take care to have an own EP application pending, which is drafted by
themselves and covers the MULTISAW invention. Therefore, MULTISAW-EP
should be refiled, although it is no more possible to claim priority, since the priority
period has lapsed. The refiling should take place as soon as possible, best before
the meeting with Dr. Bissig and in any case before publication of MULTISAW-DE,
which will be by end Of May 2002, in order to avoid that this document becomes
published prior art.
For protecting Our interests, the following steps should be taken:
As regards MULTISAW, the application MULTISAW-EP of 27.11.2001 should be
withdrawn as soon as possible. Probably the search has not yet started, so that the
search fee will be reimbursed (Article 10 (4) RRFees). MULTISAW-DE must be
kept alive to have at least this national application with earlier date pending in DE
In the application MULTISAW-EP to be refiled, there should also be a description
and claims directed to the use Of COOLMIX in the MULTISAW-technology.
We should further keep a watch on CUT-PCT for making sure whether the regional
phase before the EPO has started. If CUT-PCT, which will be published by
20.06.2002, enters the regional phase before the EPO, it might be taken into
account under Article 54 (3) EPC with respect to the new MULTISAW-EP_
However, the disclosure is due to an evident abuse in relation to SILWAFE
(Article 55 (1 ) (a) EPC). SILWAFE must submit evidence Of the abuse to the EPO.
BLOWSAW should be patentable on its own and could therefore be the basis of a
new patent application. The corresponding description, claims and drawings could,
however, also be added when refiling MULTISAW-EP. The claims should be
directed to the process and the device. Since the computer program appears to be
patentable in accordance with the principles set out in the decision T 1173/97,
claims should also be directed to the computer program. In this case, the student
who had drafted the program will probably be co-inventor and has to be designated
besides Mr Klug and his colleague who have invented the process and the device.
However, the student cannot be validly designated as inventor because of the
unknown address. Before the EPO, this problem can e.g. be remedied by finding
out the address within the 16 months period after the filing date, or by designating
only Mr. Klug and the colleague, and correcting the designation Of inventor once
the student's address is available. There may be a future problem when filing
BLOWSAW in the US, where the inventor is the applicant. This problem can be
solved making use of Rule 4.15 PCT by first filing a PCT application directed to
BLOWSAW, or by using the new BLOWSAW-application as a priority application
for a subsequent PCT application.
Regarding COOLMIX-EP, the certified priority document has to be filed before
expiry of the 16 months term, which is on 29.032002, extended to 02.04.2002
(Easter holidays), to make sure that the priority claim is valid. There would,
however, be a notification under Rule 41 by the EPO
