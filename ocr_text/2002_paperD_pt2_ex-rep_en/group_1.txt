Examiners' Report Paper D
General Remarks
- 2002
When a specific question is asked, a specific answer is expected. Some candidates
appear to waste valuable time to address issues that are not relevant to the questions
given. Some others try to give comprehensive answers covering different specific
questions (especially in part Dll), very Often confusing different issues and thus losing
points.
Marks are given for providing answers, not for simply repeating the facts given in the
questions.
Citing articles, rules, decisions etc. is not per se an answer. Citations should support the
answers, not take their place.
Candidates should not apply EPC provisions to PCT situations, and viceversa.
Candidates should pay more attention to time calculations.
Finally, candidates are free to chose the order they prefer to give their anwers;
however, in Dll, the order of the questions is chosen to make it easier to address all the
necessary aspects in a logical progression.
