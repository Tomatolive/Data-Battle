drawings and was therefore validly filed. The priority claim is still not valid, since
the certified priority document has not been filed. If the priority lapses, COOLMIX-
DE, if published, will become a national right with earlier date, only relevant in DE.
SILWAFE's mixture of COOLMIX and surfactants was not contained in COOLMIX-
DE, but was described for the first time in COOLMIX-EP, which was filed on
27.11.2001. Hence, SILWAFE's mixture of COOLMIX and surfactants only has the
date Of filing Of COOLMIX-EP as priority
There is a potential risk coming from NIPPON SAWS' application CLEAN-PCT.
This application describes a combination Of COOL MIX and a special surfactant
which was not described in COOLMIX-EP. CLEAN-PCT was filed on 02.10.2000,
i.e. earlier than the relevant dates for COOLMIX alone (29.11 _ 2000) or COOLMIX
and surfactants (27.11.2001), but is not yet published. Publication in Japanese
language can be expected 18 months after the filing date, i.e. around 02.04.2002.
Under these circumstances, CLEAN-PCT can become a document which is
relevant under Article 54 (3) EPC against COOLMIX-EP, but only if it is
appropriately regionalised before the EPO by providing a translation into one of the
official languages and paying the appropriate fees. In this case, the disclosure of
CLEAN-PCT will be novelty destroying for a claim directed to COOLMIX and
surfactants in general, and probably, depending on their disclosure and our claim
wording, also of a claim directed to COOLMIX alone. CLEAN-PCT is not relevant
with respect to inventive step in connection with COOLMIX-EP_ There is, however,
also a potential risk that NIPPON SAWS KK obtains patent protection for
COOLMIX alone.
We should further take into account that CLEAN-PCT may become relevant to
SILWAFE's applications COOLMIX-US, -JP and -DE. In particular, there can be an
interference procedure in connection with COOLMIX-US.
The options SILWAFE has with respect to Z채hnli AG and the way of further
proceeding will greatly depend on the outcome of the meeting with Dr Bissig, in
particular on whether he is prepared or not to accept that they do not have the right
to the MULTISAW part of CUT-PCT.
In case that Dr. Bissig agrees, there are various options how we could proceed.
The option that the MULTISAW part is removed from CUT-PCT would bring the
application back to what was actually invented by Z채hnli AG. This solution would
only be appropriate for SILWAFE in the US and JP, since there are the valid earlier
application MULTISAW-US and -JP. In EP, however, the MULTISAW part of CUT-
PCT would simply be lost.
A more expedient option would be that Z채hnli AG assigns either the complete
CUT-PCT or the EP part thereof to SILVVAFE, whereby the loss of MULTISAW-EP
would be remedied. As stated above, SILWAFE does not need the IJS- and JP-part
Of CUT-PCT because of the better priority dates of the own applications. For the
blade part Of CUT-PCT, a free licence could be granted to Z채hnli AG
