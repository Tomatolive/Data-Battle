2.2
Further expedient options by which SILWAFE's loss of MULTISAW-EP could be
remedied would be those which end up in the filing Of a divisional application in the
regional phase before the EPO:
For instance, Zähnli AG and SILWAFE could decide to prosecute CUT-PCT
together and to become joint applicants in the international phase. After entry into
the regional phase before the EPO, a divisional application could be filed in the
name of Zähnli AG and SILWAFE. Zähnli AG could also prosecute the entire
application alone as long as it is in the international phase, and file a divisional
application after entry into the regional phase before the EPO, in the name of
Zähnli AG. Assignment Of the divisional application to SILWAFE can be carried out
upon filing or later.
In any case, a divisional application cannot be filed in the international phase, but
only when the regional phase has been duly entered, at the latest 31 months after
the priority date or earlier upon request. It should also be taken into account that
the designation Of inventor will have to be corrected by introducing Mr. Klug.
The option that Zähnli AG keeps the entire CUT-PCT and offers a licence to
SILWAFE is not appropriate, since SII_WAFE would not have any control of the
prosecution of the case.
These options would allow to maintain the desired good business relations
between both companies.
In case that Dr. Bissig is reluctant and insists on further prosecution of the entire
CUT-PCT by Zähnli alone, without any compromise, it will no more be possible to
maintain the good business relations. SILWAFE will be obliged to try to get the
MULTISAW part of CUT-PCT back by seeking a judgement. Since the PCT does
not provide regulations for applications by persons not having the right, steps can
only be taken before national law/regional offices. This means that SILWAFE can
take the necessary steps when CUT-PCT will have entered the regional phase
before the EPO Then, SILWAFE will have to open national court proceedings in
Switzerland, in accordance with Article 2-6 of the Protocol Of recognition, seeking a
judgement that they are entitled to the grant of a European patent on the basis of
the MULTISAW part Of CUT-PCT. Before the EPO, suspension Of the proceedings
should be requested
After a favourable final decision of the national court, SILWAFE has the
possibilities set out in Article 61 EPC, in particular to file a new European patent
application in respect of the MULTISAW invention. Following the principles set out
in the Enlarged Board of Appeals' decision G3/92, this latter possibility can be
applied even if CUT-PCT was abandoned by Zähnli AG.
In the US or in JP, no steps before national courts need be taken since SILWAFE's
pending applications have a better date than CUT-PCT. SILWAFE is therefore in a
better position.
