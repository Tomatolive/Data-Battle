Part II
Most candidates presented a good assessment Of the patent situation concerning the
various applications mentioned in the paper as answer to question 1, thereby obtaining a
significant number of points.
In particular, almost all candidates realised that MULTISAW-EP is in fact lost and no
possibility of repair exists making reference to G2/95 and also G3/89. In this connection,
most candidates also stated that the MULTISAW parts of CUT-PCT actually belong to
SILWAFE and that only the new saw blades were invented by Listig
With respect to the existing COOLMIX applications, most candidates realised that the
added surfactants parts of COOLMIX-EP only enjoys the date of filing as priority.
Furthermore, most candidates explained to some extent the possible dangers presented
by the earlier CLEAN-PCT application. However, points were lost for not fully discussing
the requirements of validly entering the regional phase for CLEAN-PCT in Europe to
become prior art under Article 54(3) EPC Very few candidates realised the potential risk
of later claims being directed to COOLMIX as such by NIPPON SAWS KK.
Some candidates failed to present sufficiently detailed explanations regarding the patent
situation in JP and US with respect to the MULTISAW and the COOLMIX technology.
