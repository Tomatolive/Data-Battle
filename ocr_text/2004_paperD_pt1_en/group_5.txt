Question 8
(3 points)
You are representing the applicant of an international application. The EPO, acting as
International Searching Authority (ISA) considered that the application contained 18 inventions,
despite the fact that there was only one independent claim, without alternatives formulated
therein. The independent claim was followed by a number of dependent claims.
Thus, you have received an invitation to pay additional search fees for 17 inventions. Your
client considers that he has made only one invention and strictly refuses to pay any additional
search fee. Nevertheless, he asks you to file a demand for International preliminary
examination for this international application.

b)
Under these circumstances, is it possible to have the finding of the ISA as to the number
of inventions reviewed under the provisions of the PCT?
How will the non-payment of the additional search fees affect the further prosecution of
the PCT application in the International phase?
