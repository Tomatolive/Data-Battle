Today, 24 March 2004, your client wants to file a Swiss national application CH-I as a first filing,
describing and claiming the gardening tool. Since your client is interested in having the tool
protected in all Contracting States of the EPC, he intends to file a corresponding European
patent application EP-I a few days before expiry of the priority year in 2005, claiming priority
from CH-I and designating all Contracting States.
Would you recommend your client to proceed as planned, and what steps would you propose
to take?
