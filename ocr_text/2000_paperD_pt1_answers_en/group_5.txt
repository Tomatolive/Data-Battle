1 1 . Term for responding to written opinion expired 20/3/00 — R. 80.2 PCT, calculated
from date of despatch of oppinion.
deadline has been missed
However, this will not result in the application being rejected because the results of
intemational preliminary examination are not binding on the elected (or designated
offices). A. 33(1) PCT.
Failure to address objections may result in unfavourable international preliminary
examination report but this is not in itself detrimental, it might mean, though, that
objections are raised during the national/regional phase
It may, however be possible for arguments filed now to be taken in account in the
IPER which does not need to be established until at least 28 months from the priority
date, ie 16/6/2000 — R. 69.2(i) PCT. Authorities do not need to consider any amend-
ments or arguments submitted after the deadline for response to the opinion though,
R. 66.4 PCT.
Advice is:
missing deadline is not fatal.
might still be able to have amendments/arguments taken into account. Suggest
contacting IPEA to see if they would consider these at this stage. If not, might consider
filing amendments and arguments (where possible) on entry into nat./regional phase to
speed matters up. A. 41 R. 78 PCT & A. 28, R. 52.
Time limit for filing amendments in nat./regional phase is at least 28 months from
priority under R. 52 PCT, ie 16/6/2000, R. 80.3 PCT.
