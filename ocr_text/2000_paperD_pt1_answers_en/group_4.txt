Also, the suggested approach would mean showing the prior art to the applicant
(A. 115(2) EPC). Client may prefer to keep it "up his Sleeve" until relevance could
be assessed,
However, if prior art is relevant, but examining division did not take notice Of it
(client would not be party to proceeding though filing observation) an opposition
could subsequently be filed.
Since prior art is, in any event, in the public domain there does not seem to be any
harm in submitting it to the EPO. Observations under A. 115 EPC can be made
anonymously.
9. A. IOO(c) EPC provides that an opposition may be filed on the grounds that the subject
matter of the European patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed.
Also see Guidelines D V 5.1.
If the parameter range was not disclosed either explicitly or implicitly in the application
as filed then it would appear to be added subject matter in the sense Of A. 123(2) EPC
and A. IOO(c) EPC. As such, it would seem that the opposition will be likely to be
successful, at least in relation to Claim 1 as granted.
Client should be aware, however, that if the range is not necessary to distinguish over
the prior an the competitor may be able to amend his patent to overcome the
opposition.
However, removal Of the range from claim 1 would probably be inadmissible in view Of
A. 123(3) EPC. Competitor could therefore be in a trap where he could not amend to
remove the added matter, see G 1/93 and Guidelines D - V 6.1.
In this case prospects for Successful opposition 100k good.
10. Obvious errors in application documents filed at the EPO can be corrected under
R. 88 EPC.
However, according to Guideline C VI 5.9 requests for correction under R. 88 EPC
can only be considered until the decision to grant has been handed over to the EPOS
internal postal service, also see G 12/91.
Nor can the patent be amended under R. 86 EPC or A. 123(1) EPC at this stage.
G 7/93 permits minor amendments after issue Of the R. 51 (6) communication in
exceptional circumstances. However, Since amendment is minor and obvious patentee
does not seem to be disadvantaged. Also, patent has been published EPO are
unlikely to republish now. Further, since expiry of the opposition term the EPO no
longer has responsibility for the case, patent(s) are now govemed by national law.
Applicant should try to correct error before national offices where the patent has been
entered into force.
