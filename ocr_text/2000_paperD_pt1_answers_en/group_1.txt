Yes, for intemational applications filed after 1 July 1998. Rule 94.2 PCT & A 38 PCT.
(EPO permits access to files Of EP applications — A. 128 EPC — Re Rule 94.3 PCT)
It is unlikely that the patent win be revoked because, according to G 8/93, the
withdrawal of an opposition by the opponent, who is sole appellant, terminates the
appeal proceedings irrespective of whether the proprietor agrees to the termination or
whether the patent meets the requirernents of the EPC.
Despite the provisions of R. 66(1) EPC, R. 60(2) EPC which permits the EPO to
continue opposition proceedings of it's own notion after withdrawal of those proceed-
ings, is QQ! applicable to appeal proceedings. Also see G 7/91.
You should be aware, however, that the patent would be vulnerable to revocation
under national law in the desiguted contracting states in which it has entered into
force. A. 138 1 (a) EPC provides that a patent may be revoked under national law for
lack of novelty under A. 54(EPC).
At the European patent office at Munich or its branch at The Hague (A. 75(1 EPC)
or its sub office in Berlin (notice of President of EPO Of 10/5/89).
The Spanish attorney may file in English, French or Germany at any of the above
offices A. 14(1) EPC.
He may not file in any Of the Other languages permitted by A. 14(2) EPC because the
applicant does not meet the requirements of that Article, assuming that the Argentin-
ean company does not have its principal place Of business in Spain. If the company
does have its principal place of business in Spain the application could be filed in
Spanish (k 14(2) EPC).
Application could also be filed in Spain, pursuant to R 14(2) EPC & Nat. law relating to
EPC section II — in any language permitted under either A. 14(1) & (2) EPC ie English,
French or German or official language of contracting state where company has
principal place of business. If application is filed in Spain in a language other than
Spanish it appears that a translation into Spanish is required (national law).
R. IN b(d) EPC requires a request for examination to be made within a period
21 months from priority where A. 22(1) & (2) PCT apply — as in the case here — unless
the time limit under A. 94(2) EPC expires later.
Period 21 months from priority expires 5/2/99.
A. 94(2) requires a request for exam to be filed up to the end of 6 months from when
the European patent bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.
Under A. 157(1) EPC, publication of the intemational search report shall take the place
of the European search report and the mention Of its publication in the European
Patent Bulletin.
