An appeal must be filed in writing within two months after the date Of notification of
the decision appealed from A. 108 EPC. This period runs from the date Of notification
Of the written decision — Guidelines E Ill 9.
Under normal circumstances the decision would be notified by registered letter
(R. 78(1) EPC) and notification would be deemed to have taken place on the tenth
day following posting (R. 78(2) EPC) ie by 13/12/99.
The two month period would therefore have ended 13/12/2000 (R. 83(4) EPC) but
been extended to 14/2/2000 under R. 85(1) EPC — notice Of president Of 17/9/99.
It would therefore be too late to appeal on 3/2/2000.
However, because I am appointed as representative and Was before despatch Of
the decision the decision should be notified to me under R. 81(1) EPC.
Under T 703/29, because the provisions relating to notification have not been
observed (ie the provisions Of R. 81 (1) EPC), the question Of whether notification
has effectively taken place depends, in accordance with R. 82 EPC, on whether I
have received the decision.
On this basis I only received the decision on 3/3/2000. Notification therefore only
took place on that date, leaving until 3/5/2000 to appeal.
Nevertheless, for safety a notice Of appeal including an explanation Of the circum-
Stances ought to be filed as soon as possible.
a) The applicant is required to file either a translation Of the priority document or a
declaration that the application is a complete translation of the priority document
within a period Set by the EPO or at the latest under the time limit under R. 51(6)
EPC. (R. 38(4) EPC).
The EPO will not normally request the translation or declaration earlier than the
deadline under R. 51 (6) unless it is required to examine whether the priority claim
is effective. Guideline C V 3.2 last paragraph.
I would propose filing a copy Of the article at the EPO along with observations —
under A. 115 EPC — drawing attention to the potential relevance Of the article.
The Examining division should then request filing Of a translation or declaration
(probably translation in view of application containing more text than JP application
— G. C V 3.2 penultimate Para) to enable the priority claim and hence relevance of
article to be examined.
The cost of the translation would thus have to be borne by the applicant.
b) It may still take some time to Obtain the translation and it may not be requested
by the EPO if the Examining division does not consider the article to be relevant.
