We should therefore file a new European Application and a new US Application, or a
PCT Application designating Europe and U.S. claiming priority from EPC I and EPC 4.
This must be filed by 1996 Dec 01 (Sunday) Rule 85(1) EPC 94-Peg-92
at the latest (A 87 EPC, A 4 Paris Convention, Article 8 PCT).
US Fees are heavy upfront, so to minimise expenditure in the near future and keep
Options open a PCT is advisable.
We want to keep the rights in the name of the holding companies therefoere the PCT
Applicant will be CASINO (Swiss). This is no longer a problem for Chapter II. A
competent receiving Office (Swiss Patent Office, EPO, International Bureau must be used
(A 10 Rule 19 PCT).
Which language to file in must be considered.
The EPO will probably be the competent ISA (protocol on centralisation) and therefore
dictates the language of filing (A PCT and A 16(2); Rules 12.1(a) and 35 PCT)
ne EPO will dictate GB, FR or DE and there is plenty Of time to translate into one of
these languages.
c) Fees on EPC 3
The fee for further processing RRF 2.
A renewal fee was due on 1996 February 28 (Tuesday) (Art 86(1) R 37(1) EPC) and
presumably was not paid.
This is now due with surcharge (RRF A 2-5) by 1996 August 31 Thursday (by
J 4/91).
For the PCT Application, to cover the subject matter of EPC I and EPC 4, the following
fees will be necessary (B amounts - R 96 Schedule PCT)
Basic Fee (Rule 15.20) PCT)
Designation Fees
(Rule 15.26) PCT)
(1 for EP-a11 states (R 15.i(ii) PCT)
max - 11 (R 96 PCT Schedule).
Search Fee (Rule 16.1 PCT)
a) As far as we know, the Greek Patent applications were allocated filing dates and are
regular national filings (Paris Convention A 4(2)) and could form the basis for priority
claiming European and US or PCT Applications.
b) We do not know whether the inventions have been disclosed, so it would be advisable to
claim priority for each application.
ie file for GRZI on March 28, 96 Thursday
This is probably too soon to obtain a translation into English for filing in US.
