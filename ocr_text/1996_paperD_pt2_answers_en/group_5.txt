For Europe -
Under A 54(3) EPC EPC 1 would be citable against EPL I for arrangement J for novelty,
provided it is published. We are abandoning EPC I and filing another European Application
or a PCT claiming priority from EPC 1. This will also be citable against EPL I provided it
is published (A 158 EPC) but only for novelty. Therefore since J with iron elements is novel
over J with gold elements, LEEK (DIABLO) max obtain a patent for J with iron elements.
The priority date of our claim for the lamp with iron elements is 1996 Feb 05, while the
priority date Of EPL I is 1996 January 22. Article 54(3) will therefore prevent CASINO
obtaining a patent for J with iron elements for GB, DE & FR. as for GB, FR & DE only
(A 54(4)) EPL I is prior art for novelty purposes Over CASINO's European patent (whether
via a PCT or not).
In Europe therefore, it appears that CASINO will have the right to arrangement J for all
states, and to the iron elements for all contracting states except DE, FR. GB. For these states
DIABLO will have the right to the iron elements.
DIABLO will need a licence from CASINO to manufacture their iron element arrangement
because (assuming a patent is granted to CASINO for all states for this concept) CASINO
will the master patent for arrangement J.
In return, CASINO could take a licence from DIABLO to manufacture the iron element
arrangement in FR DE GB.
The US. has a first to invent system but we are not aware of any US interest by DIABLO
at the moment.
Any conflict in the US would probably have to be resolved in interference proceedings. If we
filed a PCT in the name of CASINO, it might be advisable to enter the National Phase in the
US, early, because Of A PCT. On the Other hand, if we find out that DIABLO have
U.S. interests, this could be a good reason to file direct in the US to obtain a filing date.
