EPC 3
communication was dated Friday 10 November 1995, and sent to a Swiss company
It was therefore deemed received on 20 Nov 1995 (Rule 83(2) + (3) - meuling Of
4 months
Rule 78(3) - ten day rule).
A response was due on 20 March 1996 Wednesday
Any extension Of time had to be requested before that date (Rule 84 EPC).
Therefore the Application will be deemed withdrawn (Article 94(3)).
However, further processing Art 121 EPC is available if requested within 2 months Of a
communication under Rule 69 EPC deeming the Application withdrawn (Art 121 (2) EPC).
The omitted act - filing a response to the communication must also be completed a
(relatively small) fee paid.
We could wait for the communication, or instead request further processing immediately
(Legal Advice 13/82).
If the further processing deadline is missed despite all due care, we Can request restltution
under Art 122 EPC (J 12/92).
Protection is likely to be available in the EPC states for the lamp incorporating J,
provided priority is claimed from EPCI (see below) and for the gold elements.
Protection for the iron elements is complicated by LEEK (see below).
b) To protect the inventions in the most cost effective way
Cl was disclosed at a local Exhibition of 6 Dec 1995. This is not an intemational
exhibition (Art 55 EPC) and because the invention of Cl is geometrical, a view together
with an explanation is likely to have been a complete disclosure, even though no written
material was distributed. We are told it was non-confidential.
Therefore, to protect Cl and the gold elements (if they are still worth protecting), the
priority of EPC I must be claimed. EPC I has a filing date (A 80 EPC) although the
Application was withdrawn.
TO protect the iron elements, any new application should also claim priority from EPC 4
filed on Feb 05 96. If the iron elements are not inventive over the disclosure of the gold
elements, this disclosure could still cause problems because the priority date of the iron
elements is after the date Of the disclosure Of the gold elements (which intervening
disclosure is citable) (G 3/93).
Because the possibility of obtaining separate patent protection for the iron elements is
doubtful, and because EPC 4 does not claim priority from EPC l, there is little point in
continuing with EPC 4, even if we are in time to pay the fees with surcharge. ThlS is not
a cost effective way of protecting the iron elements and the surcharge is large -
Rule and (2) and RRFees A2-3b).
