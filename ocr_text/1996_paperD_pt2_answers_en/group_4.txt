nerefore, file a PCT Application in Greek if possible in the name Of ZORBAS at the
Greek Receiving Office specifying a suitable ISA (Rule 12. I (a) PCT)
The Application(s) for GRZ2 need not be filed with 1996 June 30 (Sunday)
- under Rule 85(1) EPC - 1996
Therefore translations can be obtained and either a PCT Appn or a separate Europem and
US Applications could be filed.
c) For a PCT Application, the fees would be as discussed for the CASINO PCT Application.
If there has been a disclosure but the language requirements of the competent Searching
Authority and R.O. make it impossible to file in Greek (check this in PCT Applicant's
Guide, volume 2), a European Application can be filed in Greek (Art 14 EPC) by fax on
the last day claiming priority (Notice OJ 6/92, 306-311) provided written confirmation is
sent simultaneously or 1m from a communication
For the US, there is a I year grace period so any disclosure since fre filing of the priority
appri would probably be allowable.
a) It is too late to claim priority from FRFI which was filed over 12 months ago (A 4 Paris
Convention, A 8 PCT, A 87 EPC).
invention has not been disclosed by FLEUR. However Fl is the same as Zl, which
may have been disclosed. and for which we should be able to maintain a priority date Of
1995 March 28; at least in Europe (see above).
Therefore, it is probably most sensible to pursue the ZORBAS application instead of the
FLEUR one.
If language requlrements make it impossible to claim priority in the ZORBAS application,
either an application for the ZORBAS GRZI subject matter or this FLEUR application
could be refiled as a PCT or EP & US Applications, (or an EP Appn only could claim
priority as discussed previously).
II Cone.rns-Â»tith-PLABLQ
Lamp Ll is the same as C2 (the lamp with iron elements).
EPL I covers arrangement J with iron elements
EPL I was filed between the filing dates Of EPC I (arrMgernent J with gold elements
subclaim) and EPC 4 (arrangement J with iron elements subclaim)
Therefore for the arrangement (J) and for (J) with gold elements CASINO have the prior
European filing date
