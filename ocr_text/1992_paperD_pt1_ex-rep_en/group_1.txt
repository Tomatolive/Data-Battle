The connittee reconnends that candidates vrite clearly and avoid
slang and unusual abbreviations. Further, candidates should read
questions carefully and answer the questions asked, taking
particular care with negatives and positives. The conittee was
particularly disappointed by the ignorance of the Paris
Convention displayed in the ansvers to Question 2, Part I and
section A of Part II. It should be appreciated that it is the
interpretation and practice under EPC, not national laws, which
is to be used. There was also much rack of knowledge of the
operation of PCT. A better knowledge of recovery or correction
under Article 121 or 122 and Rule 88 vould be helptul.
Although for simple questions, a few words and a correct
reference to the Article or Rule nay be enough, there is Often a
need to provide an explanation as to Why or how the reference is
relevant. A list of all possible relevant references, a
reâ€”statement of the question and a vague answer is not enough. A
nere statement that sone article does not apply requires the
reason to be given for full narks to be achieved. Whilst sone
ansvers were too short, particularly fron French language
candidates, there were many who wrote much to nuch. It helps to
Leave sone space between answers to different questions .
Candidates are expected to bear in nind that they are acting in
the interest Of their client and to give practical
reconnendations. Candidates should not be surprised if sone parts
of the answers are the Sane in different sections.
The following gives Tutors a Very abbreviated guide to the
possible basis for good answers.
