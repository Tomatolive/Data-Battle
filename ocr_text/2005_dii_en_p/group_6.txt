The use of recycled plastic for the foam core is not really new to me, since I have myself
considered this obvious choice of material after having learned in May 2002 about the
foam core structure of EPI In fact, the wing shown at the wedding also included a foam
core made from recycled plastic material At that time, I decided to try to keep the use of
recycled plastic secret, since the interior of a wing would not be visible. No delivery was
made before February 2004 when I delivered some wings with a core of foamed,
recycled plastic to a customer in Germany. However, during installation, an accident
happened and one of the wings dropped to the ground and broke. With a letter of last
week, Mr. Cervantes indicated having recently gained knowledge of this incident, and
thus of our use of recycled plastics for foamed wing cores. Consequently, he has invited
us to a meeting on 16_04.2005.
We know that DQWE, whose manufacturing facilities all are located in Spain, already
has made extensive sales of wings according to the technology disclosed in PCTI in
Europe and in the USA
Another aspect of commercial importance is a tender for a large contract for supplying
wings to a major Californian windmill park where we are competing against DQWE The
deadline for submitting offers is Strong interest has been expressed by the
Californian company in the recently patented flap technology of EP2 and we are
convinced that being able to deliver wings with this technology would be vital to securing
the order. If getting the order, we would of course prefer to make use of the less
expensive recycled plastic material for the foamed cores.
