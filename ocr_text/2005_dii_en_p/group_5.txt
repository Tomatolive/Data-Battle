Another possible conflict with DQWE may arise due to a PCT application, PCTI, filed in
English at the EPO on by Mr. Cervantes. He is applicant and named as
inventor. PCTI describes a process for manufacturing a windmill wing having a core
made from foamed, recycled plastics. The foamed core is fully encapsulated by a
smooth, hard shell making the core as such non-vislble. In PCTI, the essence of the
invention is seen in the use of recycled plastic, which is a very cheap material in
comparison with virgin plastic. Recycled plastic is easily distinguishable from virgin
plastic in that it is multi-colored. The claims of PCTI are directed to the process and to
the resulting wing. PCTI was published in January 2004 with a search report citing no
relevant documents. PCTI was validly regionalized and is pending in the examination
phase before the EPO A corresponding US application was granted in unamended form
in February 2005
To me it appears obvious that Mr. Cervantes somehow had gained knowledge of the
foamed core technology of EPI and based PCTI on this knowledge. Mr. Vinge â€” being
the only other person apan from me knowing about the interior of the displayed wing -
vaguely remembers a late-night discussion at the wedding with Mr. Cervantes about the
wing. However, this was shortly before he had to be brought home by Mrs. Mnge and he
cannot - or will not - recall the conversation in any detail.
