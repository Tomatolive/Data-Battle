During the meeting earlier today, ML Vinge informed me that he would like to retire and
give up all business activities. He offered to assign to me all rights resulting from EPI for
the price of EUR 2 million. He also offered EP2 and all national patents resulting from
EP2 to me for the price of EUR 5 million. Further, he informed me that the same offer
had been made to DQWE However, for family reasons, Mr. Vinge has given me two
days to consider these offers before resuming talks with DQWE Mr. Vinge also informed
me that Mr. Cervantes has deposited a binding agreement to purchase any rights that
MOWE does not purchase.
To assist me in making my decision, Mr. Vinge handed over a copy of his complete files
regarding both EPI and EP2. I noticed that EPI as originally filed additionally contains
the seven pages of text identical to the description of EP2, but that the technical content
of these pages appear nowhere in the application as later published. When asked about
this, Mr. Vinge explained, that erroneously these pages were omitted when filing the
English translation of EPI_ All relevant fees for EPI and EP2 have been duly paid.
I consider the flap technology of vital importance and I am thus inclined to accept buying
EP2 for the stated price. As regards EPI, I consider this technology alone as being less
important for MÃ–WE, and as such not worth the asking price of EUR 2 million. In my
belief, the foamed core technology is only truly interesting in economical terms when
used in combination with the recycled plastics as disclosed
