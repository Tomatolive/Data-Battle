Present at the party was also Mr. Cervantes, who owns our main competitor, the
Spanish company Don Quichotte Wind Enterprises (DQWE)_ Mr. Cervantes — who had
been invited by Mr. Vinge — is known to run his business in a rather aggressive manner.
Shortly after filing EP3, I discussed with Mr Cervantes and some other guests from the
windmill industry my new dimple-based noise-reduction technology.
Later I learned that on the very evening of the wedding, around 23h00, ML Cervantes
filed also by fax a European application, EP4. He is applicant and named as inventor
EP4 describes and claims a wing with the very same arrangement of dimples as shown
by the prototype. EP4 also clams an alternative in the form of a wing with small knobs,
i.e. protrusions, in the same region near the wing tip. The dimples and the knobs are
as is commonly known and as also acknowledged in the description of EP4
equivalents in that they serve substantially the same purpose and obtain substantially
the same effect. From the description of EP4, it is clear that the inventive contribution is
seen solely in the new and surprising noise reduction resulting from the specific location
of the dimples/knobs near the wing tip. EP4 was published in January 2004 with a
search report citing no relevant documents. The application is validly pending in the
examination phase before the EPO and all relevant fees have been paid.
In their current sales catalogues, both MÖWE and DQWE show wings with dimples.
DQWE additionally shows the equivalent knobs. No sales have yet been made by either
company. However, the technology is believed to be commercially important, since low
noise windmills can be placed closer to residential areas.
