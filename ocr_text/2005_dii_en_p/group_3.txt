Although the claims of EP2 are fully supported by the description and the invention is
fully understandable based on the seven pages of description alone, he filed the missing
drawings on 25.05_2002_ When asked by the EPO, Mr. Vinge requested that the
application be re-dated to the date on which the drawings were filed. These drawings
contain no further technical information. An English translation was filed on 2507.2002.
EP2 was published in autumn 2003 and again the search report cited no relevant
documents. Publication of the grant of the European patent took place on
and the patent has been duly validated in all designated states.
In order to enable testing and evaluation, Mr. Vinge informed me fully and in all detail
about EPI and EP2 on the 15.05_2002 under a written secrecy agreement
On 04.07_2002 we celebrated the wedding between Mr. Vinge's daughter and my son.
The wedding party took place in my house and garden and some 200 invited guests,
including important business associates and contacts of Mr. Mnge and myself,
participated. Much to my surprise and immediate concern, I realized that my wife had
arranged for a large five tons prototype wing to be placed in the garden for decorative
purposes, on the day of the wedding. The wing included flaps according to EP2, a
foamed non-visible core according to EPI and a plurality of small dimples. Dimples are
small surface indentations, which are known to be noise reducing However, I found out
that when the dimples are placed exclusively in a very specific region near the wing tip
(as in the prototype), they are surprisingly efficient in reducing noise generation. Later
the same evening, around 19h00, I managed to put together and file by fax a European
patent application, EP3, in English language describing and claiming a wing with this
dimple-arrangement and describing the surprising effect of this arrangement I am
applicant and named as inventor. EP3 was published in January 2004 with a search
report citing no relevant documents. The application is validly pending in the
examination phase before the EPO and all relevant fees have been paid.
