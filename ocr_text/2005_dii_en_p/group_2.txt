You are a qualified European Patent Attorney and today you received the following letter
from the Danish Company "Möller Wind Enterprises" (MÖWE), for whom you hold a
general authorization before the EPO MOWE sells windmills and has all its
development and manufacturing facilities situated in Denmark.
"Dear Madam/Sir,
Earlier today, I had a meeting with Mr. Vinge, an inventor and close friend, who for many
years has been active in the field of windmill technology. During this meeting, I became
aware of certain facts and problems, which I believe need immediate attention.
On 29.04_2002, Mr. Vinge filed in Danish a European application, EPI, designating all
contracting states. Mr. Mnge is applicant and named as inventor EPI describes a
process for manufacturing a windmill wing having a core made of a foamed plastic
material fully encapsulated by a smooth, hard shell. In this way a lighter and less
expensive wing is obtainable as compared to prior art wings. The claims are directed to
both the process and to the wing. The application includes no drawings. A translation
into English was filed on EPI was published in autumn 2003 and the search
report cited no relevant documents. Mr. Vinge has been informed by the EPO that
publication of the grant of the European patent will take place in early April 2005. The
patent will be granted with the same text as the published application.
Also on 29.04_2002 Mr. Mnge filed another European application, EP2, in Danish and
designating all contracting states. Again, Mr. Vinge is applicant and is named as
inventor. EP2 describes and claims a windmill wing with adjustable flaps. By means of
such flaps a wing can be adjusted to almost any wind condition. Shortly after filing,
Mr. Vinge realized that the drawings were missing from the application.
