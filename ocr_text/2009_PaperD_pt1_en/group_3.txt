(6 points)
On 7 February 2007, applicant A filed a European patent application EPI. The publication
of the search report of EPI was mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin on 13 August
2008. Applicant A paid the designation fees for DE, FR and GB in January 2009.
A communication under Rule 112(1) EPC dated 20 February 2009 was sent to the
applicant notifying him of the deemed withdrawal of the remaining designations.
Today, applicant A becomes aware that a separate invention, disclosed but not claimed in
EPII is particularly relevant in Ireland due to a competitor's activities there. The separate
invention lacks unity with the independent claims of EPI
Applicant A wants to obtain patent protection in Ireland for the separate invention.
How should he proceed?
