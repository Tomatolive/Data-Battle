QUESTION 9
(4 Points)
A European patent application EPI was filed with the European Patent Office on
21 March 2005 No priority was claimed DE, GB and NL were designated.
The search report showed a European patent application Dl, which has a priority date
earlier than the filing date of EPI and which has been published after the filing date of
EPI. Dl validly designates FR, AT and TR and anticipates the subject-matter of all claims
of EPI
The search report also cites a document D2, which was published before the filing date of
EPI and which anticipates only the subject-matter of claim 1
After a first communication, the applicant amends the claims to render their subject-matter
new and inventive over D2. In April 2008, one day after having received a communication
under Rule 71 (3) EPC, the applicant files a divisional application comprising the same
application documents as in originally filed parent application EPI.
What is the relevance of Dl and D2 for the divisional application?
