In opposition proceedings before the EPO you represent an opponent who filed an
admissible opposition within the opposition period which has now expired. No further
opposition was filed. The opposition is based only on the ground that the subject-matter
of the sole independent claim of the patent as granted extends beyond the content of the
application as filed. On your client's instructions you withdrew the opposition.
Today, your client becomes aware of a clearly novelty destroying prior art document
against the independent claim and wants to draw the attention of the opposition division to
this document From file inspection you find out that the withdrawal letter is already on file.
The opposition division has not yet terminated the opposition proceedings.
Is there a possibility that the opposition division still considers the document?
