[004 When we performed a prior art search on frying pans with protrusions in
January 2011 , we only found a European patent application of the German company
"Schnell-Koch GmbH". Schnell-Koch's only factory' is located in Germany.
Schnell-Koch's application EP-3D was filed in Januan,' 2008 without a claim to priority.
The description of EP-3D states that three-dimensional (3D) protrusions on the inner
surface of a fiving pan will heat up the food much faster than a pan with a flat inner
surface, but does not mention any particular shape of protrusions. EP-3D was published
in July 2009 with a search repoll citing only A-documents. The single independent
apparatus claim of EP-3D is directed to a frying pan characterised in that its inner
surface will heat up the food much faster than a flat surface.
[005] Since EP-3D does not mention pyramidal protrusions at all, we proceeded with the
development of our new frying pans. We filed an Italian patent application IT-PYR on
19 August 2011. IT-PYRI which was published in February 2013, contains a single claim
directed to a frying pan with pyramidal protrusions on its inner surface. The description
of IT-PYR states that pyramidal protrusions are particularly advantageous because they
reduce vitamin loss in fried food.
[006] At the "Hot Pans 2013" trade fair in Bologna last January, I attended a public
presentation by Schnell-Koch, during which they showed frying pans with cubic
protrusions, and frying pans with hemispherical protrusions. Schnell-Koch stated that the
fiying pans with hemispherical protrusions were protected by their European patent
EP-HEMI and announced that they would soon stan selling these fiying pans.
