[009] Schnell-Koch's frying pans with protrusions on the inner sulface will compete with
our new frying pans with pyramidal protrusions. This situation is not acceptable for us,
since we will soon begin to sell our new frying pans. In order to get rid of EP-HEMI, we
therefore filed an opposition against EP-HEMI. We paid the opposition fee in due time.
In the notice of opposition, we put forward that the independent claim of EP-HEMI
lacked novelty over Schnell-Koch's earlier patent application EP-3D, while the
dependent claim did not involve an inventive step over EP-3D_ We drafted the opposition
in Italian, and sent it by registered mail to the EPO, where it was received on
1 February 2013.
[010] With regard to DIVI-3D, we have not yet decided what to do.
[011] I called Dr Serrano last week to inform him about Schnell-Koch's fiying pans, the
above-mentioned patents and patent applications, and about our opposition. Dr Serrano
was very surprised since he had sent a letter to Schnell-Koch in November 2007. In that
letter, Dr Serrano offered to Schnell-Koch the concept of 3D protrusions on the inner
surface of frying pans, but did not mention any particular shape of the protrusions.
Dr Serrano was particularly upset because the entire description of EP-3D was taken
from his letter. Dr Serrano had also sent a second letter to Schnell-Koch in March 2008.
In that second letter, Dr Serrano stated that cubic protrusions on the inner surface of
fiying pans render the fried food much crispier. Both letters stated that Dr Serrano was
planning to file patent applications for their contents. Dr Serrano also read out the letter
of reply from Schnell-Koch of May 2008, in which they expressed their lack of interest in
these proposals. Dr Serrano provided me with copies of the letters, and gave me
convincing evidence that Schnell-Koch are under an on-going obligation of
confidentiality.
