Part II : Legal Opinion
[001] You receive today, 26 February 2013, the following fax from Abeno Gusto, owner
of "Buona Cucina SPA", an Italian manufacturer of fiying pans. The only factory of
Buona Cucina is located in Italy.
[002] "My firm is in need of urgent advice and wishes to appoint you as its
representative. I would like to meet you on 12 March 2013 to discuss my firm's situation
but in the meantime ask you to consider the following:
[003 In the summer of 2010, we were approached by the private inventor Dr Serrano,
who had discovered that a frying pan with three-dimensional (3D) protrusions on its
inner surface heats up the food much faster than a conventional frying pan with a fiat
inner surface.
Under a confidentiality agreement, Dr Serrano suggested that we use pyramidal
protrusions on the inner surface of our next generation of frying pans. Pyramidal
protrusions are a particularly advantageous sub-type of three-dimensional protrusions,
since pyramidal protrusions surprisingly also reduce vitamin loss in fried food.
In December 2010, Dr Serrano became our technical advisor, and sold us the rights to
all the past and future results of his research on all types of three-dimensional
protrusions, including the right to file patent applications. Dr Serrano committed himself
to cooperating with us in all patent matters.
