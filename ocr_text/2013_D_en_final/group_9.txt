[007] We found EP-HEMI when we performed another prior art search after the trade
fair. EP-HEMI was filed by Schnell-Koch on 5 April 2010 and published on
15 December 2010. EP-HEMI clams the priority of German patent application DE-HEMI
filed by Schnell-Koch on 10 June 2009. EP-HEMI is identical to DE-HEMI, which is
deemed withdrawn for non-payment of the filing fee. EP-HEMI contains an independent
apparatus claim directed to a hying pan with 3D protrusions, and a dependent claim
directed to a frying pan with hemispherical protrusions. The description of EP-HEMI
states that 3D protrusions will heat up the food much faster than a conventional frying
pan with a flat inner surface. In addition to that, the description of EP-HEMI states that
hemispherical protrusions are a further particularly advantageous embodiment of 3D
protrusions. EP-HEMI also states that hemispherical protrusions have the surprising
advantage that they can be cleaned easily and do not become encrusted with food
residues. When we checked the legal status of EP-HEMI, we could see that the mention
of the grant of EP-HEMI was published on 2 May 2012, and that EP-HEMI was granted
in unamended form. We could also see that EP-HEMI had so far only been validated in
Italy.
[008] During that prior art search after the trade fair, we also checked the legal status of
EP-3D_ We could see that designation fees for EP-3D were paid only for Germany and
Italy. Further, we could see that a first communication by the examining division was
issued in July 2010 for EP-3D_ The communication stated that the claim did not meet the
requirements of Alticle 84 EPC, since it attempted to define the invention by a result to
be achieved. In the written decision by the examining division dated 26 March 2012,
EP-3D was refused for lack of clarity. In addition to that, a divisional application DIVI-3D,
relating to EP-3D, was filed by Schnell-Koch on 1 June 2012 DIVI-3D is identical to
EP-3D, but contains an additional statement in the description, according to which cubic
protrusions on the inner sulface of frying pans render the fried food much crispier
DIVI-3D was published on 27 September 2012 without a search report
