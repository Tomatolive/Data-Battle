Following G2/04, it is not recommended to file the opposition with A as the sole
opponent. Instead, should file it I.Qi.Q.tly in the name of A and B. A could withdraw as
opponent after the transfer [G2/04 r2.1
As an alternative, the opposition could be filed in the name of A as a main request, and
B as an auxilia1Y request [G2/04, r32]_
However, this latter strategy, and also filing in the name of B alone, raises the issue that
I am not entitled to represent B, as I am not an employee of B [Art. 133(3)]. Thus, I
could not file the opposition in the name of B and we would need to obtain the signature
of a qualified representative or authorised employee of B. Absent either of these, the
opposition in the name of B would be deemed not filed. Although the EPO would invite
us to rectify the missing signature [Guidelines, D-lV, 1.21(ii)], it is better to file the
opposition jointly (i.e. with A and B as opponents) with me as the common
representative [G2/04, R. 151(1)].
3. Pubn SR = 13/8/08
Rule 39(1) - Designation fees are due 6 months after publication of the European search
report That date is:
13/8/08 + 6 months [R 131(4)] 13/2/09 [Friday]
It is too late to pay any more fees in the normal deadline.
They may still be paid under further processing, as the period
excluded in Rule 135(2Y
The fufther processing deadline is.
20/2/09 + 10 days [Rule 126(2)]
2/3/09 + 2 months [Rule 131
=> 2/5/09 [Saturday], extended under Rule 134(1)
4/5/09 [Monday]
under R.39(1) is not
Therefore, the fees may still be paid until 4 May 2009, providing a 50% surcharge is also
paid [RFees, Art 2(12)]_
A divisional application may be filed from any pendinq European application [Rule
30(1)]-
As the separate invention lacks unity, it will not be possible to pursue this invention in
the present application [Art 82]. The invention is not claimed, and so was presumably
not searched. The application cannot be amended to claim unsearched subject matter
[Rule 137(4)]-
Due to non-payment of the designation fee in Ireland, the application is deemed
withdrawn in that state [Rule 39(2)]. This deemed withdrawal takes effect at the end of
the period, i.e. 13 February 2009 [G4//98]_ Therefore, the application is no
longer pending in IE.
A must therefore pay the designation fee (€85) in Ireland together with the further
processing fee (€42.50) before the deadline of 4 May 2009. A is advised to do this
before 1 April 2009 when the designation fee changes to a flat fee of €500
Once the designation fee has been paid, A may file a divisional application to the non-
unified invention [Alt 76(1); Rule 36(1)]. When filing the divisional, A should pay the
filing, search and 3rd year renewal fee, together with any necessary claims fees.
On filing the divisional, DE, FRI GB and IE will be designated [Art 76(2)].
