Provisional protection will be available on publication of the divisional [Art 67(1)]_ To
ensure earlier publication, A may wish to serve the competitor with a copy of the claims
of the divisional, or any necessary translation as required under Irish Law.
I would advise filing the divisional using the description of the application as filed to allow
maximum scope for amendment The claims should be suitably drafted to the non-
unified subject matter of interest. To ensure expedient grant, A may wish to waive his
right under Rule 70(2) to confirm to proceed, and request PACE, that is accelerated
search and examination [Notice from EPO dated 14 July 2007, Spec Ed. 3 OJ 2007, Fl].
4L The renewal fee for the 7th year is €1000 [RFees Art 2(45)].
The additional fee for belated payment is 50% of the relevant fee [RFees
A should have paid €1500.
Two weeks ago was 17 February 2009.
Renewal fees are due at the end of the month, namely 28 February' 2009 2 March
2009 [Rule 51 Rule 134(1)].
Therefore, payment was effected at least 10 days before the relevant due date
However, this is not relevant, as the 10 day fail safe arrangement of RFees Art 9(3) does
not apply, the EPO received the fees, but not enough.
According to RFees Art 8(1) first sentence, the payment was not for the full amount and
so the payment was not validly paid. According to RFees 8(1), last sentence, the EPO
may over look "small amounts". However, 847/1500 - 40% underpaid which is not a
small amount [T 161/96].
The fee is therefore not validly paid [RFees first sentence].
However, as A made the payment through a deposit account, the EPO will take the
correct amount, providing the intention is clear [T 152/82], and there are sufficient funds
in the account. Following this, the EPO will debit the correct fee of its own motiom
5/.aL The PCT application has been filed in French. According to Rule 55.1 PCT, the
Demand should be filed in the language of the application as filed, or as published (if
different)
According to PCT Applicant's Guide, Chapter C-FR, the French Patent Office only
accepts French. As French is a language of publication, and a language accepted by
the EPO as a search language, the application will be published in French.
ROCOM must therefore file the demand in French, plus any amendments to the
application in French [Rule 55.1 PCT, Rule PCT]_
Furthermore, Rule 66.9(b) PCT requires that any letter accompanying an amendment in
the IPE must be filed in the language of publication, i.e French. If the communications
to the IPEA are not in French, the IPEA will invite (subject to there bang sufficient time)
the applicant to file the amendments/letter translated Into French [Rule
In summary', ROCOM should use French, but mav be allowed to use another language
at the discretion of the EPO acting as IPEA
bL According to Article 14(4) EPC, natural or legal persons having their residence or
principle place of business in a contracting state that has an official language other than
ENI FR, DE may use that language to file documents within a time limit A translation
into an official EPO language must however be supplied within 1 month [Rule 6(2) EPCI
This translation may be in EN, FR, or DE [Rule 3(1) EPC]_
Romanian is an official language of Romania, which is a contracting state. ROCOM
may therefore file documents that need to be filed wthin a time limit in Romanian.
