IL a/_ A European patent application may be filed by any natural or legal person [Art.
58].
-4 Mr McX is therefore entitled to file the EP application
A European application shall be filed in any of the three official languages (EN, FR, DE),
or if filed in anv other language, translated into one of the official languages [AN 14(2):
Art 14(1)]-
If filed in a non-official language such as Italian, the translation into EN, FR, DE should
be filed within nvo months of the filing date [Rule 6(1)]_
The application is therefore validly filed, but a translation into EN/FR/DE must be filed
within two months of "last week" _
Note: Mr McX is QQ! entitled to a reduction in the filing fee, as he is not entitled to use
Italian in accordance with Art 14(4) EPC
bL According to Rule 3(2), amendments to a European patent application must be
filed in the language of the proceedings, i.e. French.
Under Alticle 14(4), a national or resident of a contracting state that has an official
language other than EN, FR, DE may file a document that needs to be filed "within a
time limit" in the official language of that state. However, Italian is not an official
language of the UK, and so Mr McX is not entitled to use Italiam If he were, he must
supply the translation into French within one month of "last week" [R 6(1)]. However,
since Mr McX is not entitled, R.3(2) requires that the amendments should have been
filed in French.
Conclusion: The amendments are not validly filed [AN 14(4)].
CL An opposition is a document to be filed in a time limit, and so potentially could be
filed in Italian if Mr McX were entitled to use this language. However, as outlined in bL
above, Mr McX is QQ! entitled to use Italian Mr McX should have filed the opposition in
EN/FR/DE within the g month period, i.e. by yesterday [R 3(1), Art. 99(1
The opposition will be deemed not filed and the opposition fee will be refunded
[Guidelines, D-l\./, 1.2.1(v)]_
The opposition will be fonnarded to the proprietor and put on the file as 3rd party
observations [Art 115].
2L An opposition must be filed within g months [Art 99(1)]_ It must therefore be filed
today
According to G3/gg, an opposition can be filed with joint opponents [construed in the
light of Art. 58]. Therefore, in principle it would be possible to file the opposition in the
name of A & B
According to G4/88, an opposition can be transferred or assigned to a third party as part
of the opponents business assets. However, this position was restricted in G2/04,
which held that a conglomerate that filed an opposition could not transfer the opposition
together with the subsidiary's assets, as it was deemed that the opposition could and
should have been filed in the name of the subsidiary
