More generally, any party may use English in written proceedings before the EPO [Rule
3(1)]_ However, ROCOM must file amendments (or translations of any amendments) to
the application in French, as this is the language of the proceedings [Rule 3(2)]_
The question of whether ROCOM could change the language of the proceedings by
filing a translation under Rule EPC has been referred to the Enlarged Board of
Appeal [G4/08]_
6L a/_ A European patent application may be licensed in whole or in part for the whole
or part of a contracting state [Art 73].
According to Art. 74 EPC, the provisions of the EPC prevail over national law for the
registration of the license.
The licensee may be recorded on the European Patent Register at the request of the
licensee, upon production of the relevant documentation an payment of the necessary
fee [Rule 23(1) referring to Rules 22(1) and 22(2)1 A should therefore send the license
documentation to the EPO and request its recordal.
bL According to Rule 24(a), a request to record an exclusive license can only be
possible with the agreement of the exclusive licensee and the applicant In this event, A
will need to seek B's consent to record the license on the Register. The same steps as
outlines in a/_ above are required, only that B's consent is now required.
Absent B's consent, the license may only be recorded as a non-exclusive license, or
possibly not recorded at all [no case law on this].
7L Added-matter is a ground for opposition [Art 100(c)]_ Therefore the opposition
was based on valid grounds.
The withdrawal has been published and therefore is irrevocable. As the opposition
period has passed, it is not possible to file a new opposition.
According to (39/91, the opposition is limited to the parts of the patent opposed. In this
case, as there is only one claim, it is opposed in its entirety.
According to GIO/91, the Opposition Division is not obliged to consider grounds that
have not been raised in the notice of opposition. Novelty is a new ground, so the OD is
not obliged to consider it
However, the OD will continue with the opposition of its own motion in accordance with
Art 114(1
Under Ait 114(1), the OD will, in principle, examine other grounds if they are prima facie
prejudicial to the maintenance of the patent
We could file the novelty destroying prior art document together with comments on how
this document prejudices novelty under Art 115 (which refers to Art 54). These
observations would be forvvarded to the patentee and may be taken into account by the
opposition division in its examination under Art 1 However, we would not
be party to the proceedings [Art 1 15, last sentence].
According to T 1002/92, late filed documents that go beyond the statement of grounds
would exceptionally be admitted if there are prima facie grounds to suspect that the
material will prejudice maintenance of the patent On this basis, they may be admitted
and considered by the Opposition Division.
