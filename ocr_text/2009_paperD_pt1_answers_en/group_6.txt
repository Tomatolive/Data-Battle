In contrast, Dl is not prior aft against EPI, since it does not have any commonly
designated states [Art 54(3) & 54(4); Rule 23a EPC1973].
Thus, while Dl was not relevant to EPI , it is relevant to the divisional
As Dl anticipates the subject matter of all of the claims of EPI, it is to be expected that
the divisional application will lack novelty over Dl (at least the claims as filed do), and
will therefore not lead to grant of a patent. This is of course assuming that EPI had no
subject matter in the description which could be novel over Dl _
Note, as Dl is a 54(3) prior art document, it would be possible to establish novelty over
Dl by using a disclaimer [GI /03].
