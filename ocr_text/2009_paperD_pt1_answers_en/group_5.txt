8L A divisional application may be filed from any pending European application [Rule
36(1)]-
The filing fee [€180, RFees 2(1)] and search fee [€1050, RFees 2(2)] must be paid
within one month of filing the divisional application [Rule 36(3)], i.e
3/3/09 + 1 month [Rule 131(4)] 3 April 2009 [Friday]
Both the search and filing fee may be paid later using further processing. However as
the invention has already been searched, the applicant should request a refund of the
search fee [RFees and provide a copy of the earlier search report
Additionally, the claims fees of €200 [RFees 2(15)] for the 16th-20th claims should be
filed within one month of the filing of the first set of claims [Rule that is 3 March
2009 + 1 month [Rule 131(4)] 3 April 2009.
Even though the claims fees have been paid on the parent application, they must still be
paid on the divisional application [Guidelines, A-IV, If the applicant fails to pay
the claims fee, he is invited to do so within 1 month [Rule 45(2)1
Renewal fees are calculated from the date of filing of the parent application. The third
year renewal fee of the parent is therefore due 28 Februan,' 2010 [Rule 51(1); RFees
2(4)]_ A renewal fee is therefore not due for the divisional application (Rule 51(3)
indicates renewal fees already due). The renewal fee for the third year of the divisional
is therefore also due 28 February 2010 [Rule 51(1) EPC; Art 76(1) last sentence (FD of
divisional is FD of parent)l
The designation fees for the divisional application will be due 6 months from the date on
which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the Search Report drawn
up on the divisional application [Rule 36(4)]. This date is not yet known. The amounts
designation fees are dictated by RFees Article 2(3) and 2(3a), presently 85 Euros
However, after 1 April 2009, the designation fee is changing to a single designation fee
of €500 to designate all contracting states [RFees 2(3)]_
The Examination fee becomes due 6 months after the publication of the European
Search Report [Rule 70(1)]. The amount is €1405 [RFees 2(6)]_
The divisional application is filed in April 2008, which is after EPC2000 came into
force (i.e after 13 December 2007).
According to Article 1(1) of the Dec. Admin Council of 28 June 2001, Article 54(3)
EPC2000 applies to applications pending on entry' into force of EPC2000, however
Article 54(4) EPC1973 applies only to applications filed under EPC1973 [see also Alt 7
of the act revising the EPC, 29 December 2000].
As the divisional application is actually filed under Art 76(1) EPC2000, Art 54(4)
EPC1973 does not apply to the divisional application. Although the divisional will be
accorded the filing/priority of the present application [Art 76(1)], this is a legal fiction for
prior art purposes, Art 54(3) EPC2000 shall apply.
Under EPC2000, Dl will constitute a prior right under Article 54(3) for all designated
states in the divisional application, namely DE, GB and NL [Art 76(2)]_
Thus, Dl will be citable for novelty against the divisional application, Dl will however not
constitute prior art for the purpose of assessing inventive step [Alt 56 referring to Art
54(3)]-
D2 was published before the filing date of EPI , and therefore constitutes prior art under
Art 54(2) EPC and is citable for both novelty and inventive step.
