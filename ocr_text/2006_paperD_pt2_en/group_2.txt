Dear representative,
I wish to seek your advice on a number of issues which are set out below.
We are a Dutch company active in the field of building materials and have laboratories
and manufacturing sites at various places in Europe. We manufacture and sell thermal
solar panels.
Our panels are made of two superposed parallel sheets of plastic material held at a
distance from each other by means of numerous straight parallel walls. The walls are
perpendicular to the sheets and define ducts between the latter At either end of the
panel these ducts communicate with two transverse ducts: one for feeding the panel
with water, the other for evacuating it Solar rays heat the water passing through the
panel. Such panels are well known.
We found that replacing the usual straight walls with undulating (i.e. wavy) ones
increased the thermal efficiency of the panel. We filed a national patent application Fl in
France on 1 October 2003, claiming solar panels with undulating walls and mentioning,
as an example, a test panel one metre long with walls having seventeen undulations per
metre. We also described and claimed an extrusion process by which the panel is
produced by extruding molten plastic material with a vibrating extrusion nozzle.
