We then found that with respect to the walls the number of undulations was highly
significant In our German laboratory we surprisingly found that, in order to obtain better
results, the number of undulations had to be between five and sixteen undulations per
metre length. We filed an application for a German utility model, Dl , on 15 March 2004.
It described and claimed panels having undulating walls and the improved range of five
to sixteen undulations per metre. The embodiments described were all test panels one
metre long. The claims were not limited to any size of panel. Dl was made publicly
available on 15 September 2004.
Shortly after filing Dl we realised that we had limited ourselves too much. According to
our Italian laboratory, said better results were obtained with walls having up to thirty
undulations per metre. What really matters is the size of the panel: the number chosen
should be up to sixteen for smaller sizes, i.e. for panels under three metres long, and
between fifteen and thirty for larger sizes, i.e. for panels over three metres long. We filed
a third application ITI on 22 September 2004 describing these different ranges and
having claims covering both the range from five to sixteen undulations per metre for
smaller panels, and the range from fifteen to thirty undulations per metre for larger
panels. We included examples clearly demonstrating this technical improvement over
both claimed ranges for all integer values of undulations per metre.
