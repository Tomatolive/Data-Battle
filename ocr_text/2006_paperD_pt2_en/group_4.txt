We filed an international application, PCTI, on 1 October 2004 claiming the three
priorities and containing all the information disclosed in the priority applications. All the
inventors are our employees and have signed appropriate assignments for the PCT
application and the relevant priorities. PCTI has the following clams.
claim 1 directed to solar panels having undulating walls,
claim 2 to solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 undulations/metre,
claim 3 to solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 undulations/metre and
<3m length,
claim 4 to solar panels having undulating walls with 15-30 undulations/metre and
>3m length,
claim 5 directed to the extrusion process.
The only document dealing with this type of solar panel that we know is an article that
we found in "The Proceedings of the 2002 Tokyo Symposium on Solar Panels". The
symposium was held in 2002, but the proceedings of the symposium were not published
until May 2004. The article mentions the use of undulating walls to mechanically
strengthen the panels. It mentions only one example, a panel one metre long with walls
having twenty undulations per metre. No other disclosure appears to have been made.
