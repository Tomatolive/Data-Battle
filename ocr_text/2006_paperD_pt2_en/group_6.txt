We are still working on the launch of our product and know that it will soon be time to
enter the national phases for PCTI in other countries outside Europe. As we have
interested investors, but do not expect decisions before June, I would not like to pay the
patent costs for nothing if the decisions prove negative.
Are each of claims 1 to 5 valid in Euro-PCTI, and if not, can we improve them?
Can we extend our Euro-PCTI to cover the United Kingdom and Belgium?
Is there an easy way to postpone national phase entry for PCTI outside Europe
without paying surcharges?
Can we stop Mr Bad from marketing his panels?
Can Mr Bad stop us from marketing our panels?
