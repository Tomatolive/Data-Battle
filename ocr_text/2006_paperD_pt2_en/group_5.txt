Thus everything was in order until we discovered the publication of a European patent
application EPB that was filed shortly after Dl in April 2004. It claims a new structure for
the superposed parallel sheets of a solar panel. However, it describes two examples of
solar panels, with undulating walls. The h,vo examples have ten and twenty undulations
per metre respectively, the first being two metres long and the second four metres long.
No explanation is given for the undulations. It appears that EPB was filed by our
competitor, Mr Bad. I am of the opinion that he received the information from our
research manager, Mr Ugly, himself. Mr Ugly left our company suddenly two years ago.
I conducted some investigations and learned that Mr Bad presented a panel having
walls with undulations at a trade fair on the Costa del Sol in Span in October 2005. He
is offering panels of all sizes. We have located no other disclosure of Mr Bad's panels or
any applications equivalent to EPB elsewhere. We entered the EP phase of PCTI
immediately (Euro-PCTI), in November 2005, and designated DE, FR and IT to cover
our market
At a meeting recently, I took the opportunity to tell Mr Bad what I thought of his
behaviour. He admitted nothing, suggesting that it will be difficult for us to prove
anything. He said he was willing to maintain our good relations and was ready to
withdraw the conflicting embodiments in application EPB for the three countries
(DE, FR and IT) that were designated in our application.
I am not sure whether to accept this offer, as we envisage good sales throughout
Europe. I should now like to cover other European countries, particularly as Mr Bad has
now launched two types of panel with undulating walls (one with ten undulations per
metre, the other with twenty undulations per metre) in the United Kingdom and Belgium.
