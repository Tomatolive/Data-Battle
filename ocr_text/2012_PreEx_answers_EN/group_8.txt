step could be "characterised by removing the closure by pulling the pull-tab so that the
sealing part provides evidence of tampering.

Question 18
In the context of the problem-solution approach, the objective technical problem means the
aim and task of modifying or adapting the closest prior art to provide the technical effect
that the invention provides over the closest prior art, see Guidelines, C-IV, 11.5_2, third
paragraph. The distinguishing feature over D2 (the sealing part consists solely of the
aluminium foil) provides the technical effect that the alumnium foil tears on removing the
closure. In view of this, the only valid definition of the objective technical problem is to
enable the detection of tampering. Statement 18.1 recites an effect of the distinguishing
feature and is a part of the solution, but is not an objective technical problem with respect
to D? Statements 182 and 184 are at best speculative aspects that are not derivable
from the application as filed and are not related to the claimed distinguishing feature

Question 19
The closest prior art is the second embodiment of D2, where the pull tab is lightly attached
to the sealing part The statement of 19.1, which is directed solely to the first embodiment
of D2 and does not acknowledge the second embodiment of [32, is not helpful to define
why it would not be obvious to provide the claimed features. However, the statement 19.2
is relevant as it demonstrates that D2 teaches a different solution to that claimed in
Claim A valid argument is necessarily directed to the features recited in the
independent claim. The argument set out in 19.3 is therefore a valid argument in respect of
Claim However, as Claim IX does not recite dots of adhesive, the argument set out in
19.4 relating to dots of adhesive is irrelevant.
