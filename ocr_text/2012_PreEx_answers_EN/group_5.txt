Question 11
The subject-matter of Claim I reads on to a closure as shown in Figures 1-3 and in
Figure 4. The thermoweldable material is on a first surface of the sealing part It is not
specified whether or not the sealing part includes the polyester film (22); both options are
possible _
The subject-matter of Claim I lacks novelty over Dl. Dl also discloses a closure on a
bottle, the closure comprising an aluminium foil (6) with a thin layer of thermoweldable
material (9) on a first surface; the thermoweldable material allowing attaching of the
closure to an opening of a bottle; and a tab part (8) extending over part of the second
surface of the aluminium foil (6), the pull-tab (8) being arranged to be gripped to remove
the closure from the bottle.
The closure of Claim I is on a bottle; therefore the subject-matter of Claim I does not
protect a closure independently of a bottle.

Question 12
The subject-matter of Claim II reads on to a closure as shown in Figures 1-3 and in
Figure 4. The thermoweldable material is on a first surface of the sealing part. It is not
specified whether or not the sealing part includes the polyester film (22); both options are
possible _
The subject-matter of Claim II is novel over Dl _ Dl discloses only two layers of material
(6 and 9) but the closure of Claim II includes at least three material layers: a
thermoweldable material (26), a first sheet (24) and tab-part (12) comprising a second
sheet of material.
