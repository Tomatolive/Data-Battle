why it would not be obvious to provide the claimed features. However, the statement 20.2
is relevant as it demonstrates that D2 teaches a different solution to that claimed in
Claim X. A valid argument is necessarily directed to the features recited in the independent
clam. The argument set out in 20.3 is not directed to the characterising features of
Claim X and is therefore not a valid argument in support of inventive step being provided
by the claimed features. However, the argument set out in 20.4 is a valid argument in the
light of the claimed features.
