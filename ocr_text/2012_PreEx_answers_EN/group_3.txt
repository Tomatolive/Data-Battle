application to an invention that was covered by the international search report, i.e. the third
invention, Rule 164(2) EPC After entry into the European phase the applicant can file a

supplementary European search report is not drawn up where the international search
report was drawn up by the EPOI Article 153(7) EPC and Decision of the Administrative
Council of 2810.2009 (OJ EPO 2004 594Y The applicant will have no opportunity to pay

Question 5
Feature A is part of the state of the art under Article 54(2) EPC by publication of USI on 1
February 2010 Feature B is part of the state of the art under Article 54(2) EPC by
publication of EPI in December 201 The subject-matter of claim 2 of EP2 is inventive as
it was not obvious to the skilled person until feature B became part of the prior art in
December 2011 , Alticle 56 EPC, second sentence. If EP2 had not claimed priority from
EPI the situation would have been as follows: the fiction under Article 89 EPC that 1 June
2010 counts as date of filing of EP2 for the purpose of Article 54, paragraphs 2 and 3, EPC
would not apply; EPI would have been prior art under Article 54(3) EPC against EP2; and
the content of EPI would have rendered claim 1 of EP2 not novel. However, as EP2
claims priority from EPI , the effective date for feature B is 1 June 2010, Alticle 89 EPC
Thus no valid novelty objection against claim 1 of EP2 can be made using EPI _ The
subject-matter of claim 2 is novel as it is not disclosed in the prior art neither USI nor EPI
disclose the combination of features B and A.

Question 6
If EP-D contains subject-matter extending over the earlier application it cannot be
converted into an independent application taking 10 February 2012 as its date of filing for
all or part of its subject-matter. In such a case, EP-D can be amended to remove all
additional matter to comply with the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC_ If the applicant is
unwilling to remedy the defect by removal of the additional subject-matter, the divisional
application is refused under Article 97(2) EPC due to non-compliance with Article 76(1)
EPC. The claims of a divisional application need not be limited to subject-matter already
claimed in the earlier application. (Guidelines, C-VI, 9.1_4, G 1/05).
