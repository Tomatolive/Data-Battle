vas published on 30 January 1991 ; E, F and G are patents vhich

was rejected at first instance, but appeal proceedings are still
pending) . Can European patent applications and Patents also be
transferred for one particular designated State, what
requirements must be met tor the transfer to be registered, and
Vhich EPO provisions apply to the different cases specified?

against a European patent by the German firm W he has taken over.

period. What i s the lega 1 position?
