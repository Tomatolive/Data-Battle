Question 10
(6 points)
European patent application EP-IT was duly filed by Italian company ITSA in Italian language
a few years ago. A translation of the application into the French language was filed in due time.
Recently, ITSA was taken over by US company USCO. It has not been decided if the
application will be transferred to USCO or be kept by ITSA, but in any case USCO are keen on
using the English language during fulther prosecution of EP-IT before the EPO USCO ask you,
as their European patent attorney, the following questions:
a) Can the English language be used by you and/or the EPO in the written procedure
during substantive examination of EP-ITQ
b) Can the English language be used by you and/or the examining division in oral
proceedings taking place during substantive examination of EP-IT?
c) Which languages can be used by either USCO or ITSA for filing a divisional application
based on EP-IT?
d) In case of observations by third parties concerning the patentability of the invention of
EP-IT, in which language has their statement of grounds to be presented?
