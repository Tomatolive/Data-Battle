Question 8
(5 points)
Your client is patent proprietor in an appeal procedure against a decision of an opposition
division to reject the opposition of the sole opponent O. The opponent has filed a new relevant
prior art document Dl together with the statement setting out the grounds for appeal. Your
client thinks that document Dl prejudices the maintenance of the patent and intends to restrict
the patent to make sure that his patent is valid. Therefore, you have filed a restricted set of
claims in due time before the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal. The
opponent/appellant has lost interest in this case and has withdrawn his opposition immediately
before the oral proceedings.
Can your client restrict the patent?
