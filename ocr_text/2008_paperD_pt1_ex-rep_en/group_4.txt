Answer to question 5 (4 marks):
According to Article 59 EPC, two applicants may file a European patent application
designating different contracting states. According to Article 118 EPC applicants who each
designated different states for an application shall be regarded as joint applicants, so that
the unity of the application is not affected. The divisional application can only be filed in
common, see J2/01 (OJ 2005, 88). Therefore EP-D is not treated as a divisional
application.
According to Rule 36(1) EPC, the applicant may file a divisional application relating to any
pending earlier application. A new divisional application can still be filed in the name of
both applicants, Article 76 EPC, Rule 36(1) EPC After filing, transfer of rights from
applicant B to A may be performed.
