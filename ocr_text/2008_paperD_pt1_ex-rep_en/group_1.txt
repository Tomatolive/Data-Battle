Examiners' Report Paper D 2008 Part I
This was the first EQE after entry into force of EPC 2000. Most Candidates demonstrated
to be well familiar with the new provisions and thus they were able to collect most of the
marks available for EPC 2000 issues, both in Dl and in D2
The questions relating to EPC 2000 were generally well answered. As usual, it is essential
that candidates gwe a complete and detailed legal basis including the appropriate articles
and rules. This applies in particular to questions relating to the PCT. In general, mere
citation of the guidelines, decisions or the applicant's guide may not be sufficient to gain
full marks for a question.
In detail:
Question 1
The requirements for obtaining a filing date under EPC 2000 were well understood by the
candidates. Also the formal requirements to start with the search were correctly listed.
Question 2
Most candidates recognised that the right to priority can be saved by filing a request for re-
establishment of rights even though some candidates missed that the time limit for
requesting re-establishment is calculated from the end of the missed priority period.
Moreover, some candidates also failed to point out that it is necessary to actually file EP-X_
The omitted act is not just claiming the priority but also filing said application.
Question 3
Most candidates recognized that the transitional provisions were to be applied. However,
some answers were based on the provisions of Article 54(4) EPC 1973 together With Rule
138 EPC 2000 rather than Rule 87 EPC 1973. However, Rule 138 EPC 2000 is only
applicable for existing national prior rights under Article 139(2) EPC 2000.
Question 4
Few candidates realised that the third party has to file proof that proceedings for
infringement had been instituted against him. This is required according to Article
EPC_
Question 5
The answer given to this question shows that some candidates cite case law without
referring to the related provisions of the EPC. In this case, many cited J2/01 without
mentioning Article 59 EPC and Article 118 EPC Surprisingly few candidates mentioned
that a new divisional application should be filed and that the rights should be transferred
after filing thereof.
Question 6
The application was filed for all contracting states, i.e. including the US. Many candidates
overlooked that the inventors X and Y were applicants for the US, though, and their
signatures were required, too.
