Possible Solution - Paper D 2008 - Part I
Answer to question 1 (7 marks):
a) It is possible to file a European patent application in Japanese, Article 14(2) EPC_ The
fax contains an indication that a European patent is sought, therefore, Rule 40(1)(a)
EPC is fulfilled. Name and e-mail address, or fax response number, are sufficient for
identification if they allow the applicant to be contacted, Rule 40(1)(b) EPC The article
IS considered a description. Only a description is required (no claims necessary), Rule
40(1)(c) EPC_ Filing by means offax is possible, Rule 2(1) EPC, and decision of the
President 12 July 2007, special edition Nr 3 of OJ 2007, page 7 or Guidelines A-II 1 _2
All requirements of Rule 40 are fulfilled; according to Article 80 EPC, a date of filing is
accorded.
b) Appoint a representative, Article 133(2) EPC, Rule 57(h) EPC within nvo months from
invitation according to Rule 58 EPC File a translation into an official language of the
EPO within two months from filing the application, Article 14(2) EPC, Rule 6(1) EPC,
i.e. by 4 May 2008 (which is a Sunday), extended to 5 May 2008 (which is a holiday in
The Hague), thus extended to 6 May 2008, or according to Rule 57(a) EPC, within two
months from invitation according to Rule 58 EPC Pay filing fee and search fee within
one month of filing, Rule 38 EPC (ie_ until 4 April 2008). Use "request for grant" form

to Rule 58 EPC; Rule 57(b) EPC File clams and abstract according to Article 78(1)(c)
and (e) EPC, Rule 57(c) and (d) EPC, respectively, within nvo months from invitation
according to Rule 58 EPC_
Answer to question 2 (5 marks):
The 12 month time limit of Article 87 (1) EPC expired on 26 February 08. A German utility
model can be the basis for claiming priority for a European patent application, Article 87(1)
EPC. Since DE-IJ is available to the publC it will be novelty-destroying for EP-X under
Article 54 (2) EPC if the right of priority is not saved. A request for re-establishment
according to Article 122 EPC should be filed and the fee be paid The time limit for filing
the request and paying the fee is two months from expiry of the priority period, Rule 136(1)
EPC. This time limit ends on 26 April 08, which is a Saturday, extended to 28 April 08
according to Rule 134(1) EPC The request should state the grounds and set out the facts
on which it relies, Rule 136(2) EPC_ Application EP-X must be filed within the two month
period, Rule 136(2) EPC and the priority of DE-U must be claimed. The car accident and
the subsequent stay in the hospital appear to be sufficient grounds for re-establishment
(Guidelines E-VIII 2.21).
