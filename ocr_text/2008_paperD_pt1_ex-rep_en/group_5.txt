Answer to question 6 (5 marks):
Publication can only be avoided by withdrawing the application. Notice of withdrawal has
to be received at the International Bureau (1B) before completion of the technical
preparations for publication; Article 21 (5) PCT or Rule 90bis_ I(c) PCT. Withdraw the
application by filing a notice of withdrawal with the 1B or the Receiving Office (RO)
according to Rule 90bis_ I(b) PCT.
The technical preparations are completed by the 15th day prior to the date of publication,
which is around md-March 2008 (Nr. 305 PCT Applicant's Guide). Better file the
withdrawal at the 1B to make sure it is received in time. The notice of withdrawal has to be
signed by all applicants, Rule 90bis.5(a) PCT, which are companies B and D, and
inventors X and Y, who are applicants for the US.
Answer to question 7 (5 marks):
Rectification in the international phase is possible File a request with the 1B to record a
change in the person of the inventor by deleting Ms Grey and adding Ms White, Rule
92bis_ I(a)(ii) PCT. The request must be received by the 1B within 30 months from the
priority date, Rule 92bis_ I(b) PCT. This time limit expires on 21 March 2008 (possibly
extended because of Good Friday and Easter Mondayy The request may also be filed with
the EPO as RO (see Applicants Guide 1 429) (which will then fomard it to the 1B).
Rectification is also possible in the European phase Obtain the consent of the wrongly
designated person, and then file a request with the EPO for rectification of the designation
of inventor by deleting Ms Grey and adding Ms White Rule, 21 (1) EPC Rectification in the
international phase is preferable because the signature of the erroneously designated
person for her consent is not required.
Answer to question 8 (5 marks):
a) Yes, the priority claim can be withdrawn until the expiration of 30 months from the
priority date, Rule 90bis_3 (a) PCT, i.e. up to 14 June 2008, extended under Rule 80.5
PCT to 16 June 2008.
b) The time limit for filing a demand expires 22 months after the priority date, Rule
54bis_ I(a)(ii) PCT, or three months after transmittal of the International Search Report,
Rule 54bis. I(a)(i) PCT. The 22 month time limit, computed from the original priority
date, has already expired, i.e. on 14 October 2007 (extended under Rule 80.5 PCT to
15 October 2007). The three months time limit expired on 30 July 2007 (which is a
Monday). Both time limits already expired Therefore, withdrawal of the priority causes
no change in the computation of this time limit, Rule 90bis_3 (d) PCT. Hence, it is too
late to file demand for international preliminary examination.
