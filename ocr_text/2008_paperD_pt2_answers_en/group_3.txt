d.) Racket dumper D2_
D2 is first disclosed in FR-BEP. A valid patent can be obtained for it in FR.
EP-BEP validly claims the priority of FR-BEP (priority year of FR-BEP:
A87(1)

+EP-BEP claims the same invention as FR-BEP_ Thus has and effective date.
03/09/2005.
EP-BEP validly filed, filing date accorded but the filing and search fees not paid. They
should have been paid within 1 month from filing [e. 04/09/2006 Innâ€”i 04/10/2006. But
before the expiry of this time limit BEP was declared bankrupt from 06/09/2006
was not able to pay.
It is possible to inform EPO about bankrupt.
The EPO will probably declare the proceedings interrupted (J7/83, J26/95) retroactively
from 06/09/2006 and also inform EPO about the authorization of yesterday to allow BEP
to sell assets to meet debits. *Thus EPO will probably define a date from which
proceedings will be resumed. The filing and search fees can be paid within 1 month from
the date of resumption
If above successful EP-BEP can be saved. As D2 is novel and seems to be inventive as
achieves the same advantageous effect as Dl but in an other way a patent can be
obtained from EP-BEP for D2 in Europe.
e.) Grip G.
The grip is first disclosed in EP2_
The claim for G and RI+G in EP2 is entitled to the priority of DK-2 as G and RI+G were
first disclosed in EP2 Thus have an effective date of 29/12/2006. DK-U discloses RI
thus not relevant. As the grip is not disclosed in the prior art documents it is novel. Its
inventive step is supported by its advantageous new properties: [e. moisture absorbent
But EP2 is deemed to be withdrawn as no filing + search fee was paid.
EP2 filed before 13/12/2007 thus EPC 1973 applies. EPO notification deemed notified
on 27/12/2007. But 1 m. for paying fees expired on 14/11/2007 1m. 14/12/2007 after
13/12/2007 thus further processing is available for the payment of fees : this expires on:
27/12/2007 2m. 27/02/2008 already expired.
But re-establishment in the period of further processing is possible as it seems that all
due care can be proven. Thus request re-establishment by filing written request and
pay fee for re-establishment and pay fee for further processing + filing + search fees.
The request for re-establishment should be granted for the same reasons, on the same
basis as for EPI detailed above. Time limit for filing request for
re-establishment of rights: 2m fr. 28/02/2008 28/04/2008
Thus if re-establishment granted EP2 can be saved and patent obtained for G. Similarly
to Dl, for G protection can be obtained from DK2 if not possible via EP2, but if possible
via EP2 the protection will be longer'
