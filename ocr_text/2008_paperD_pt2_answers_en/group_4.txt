f.) Combinations:
RI + Dl first disclosed in DKI_ Thus as EPI validly claims its priority as this
combination was QQ! disclosed in DK-U only RI which is not the same invention.
RI + Dl is novel. PCT-DS is prior art 54(3) against it thus not relevant for the
assessment of inventive step. Thus as it seems to be inventive and if EPIcan be saved
as disclosed above RI + Dl can be patented by Copen Tennis.
Similarly RI+G can be patented as it is first disclosed in EP2 as DK-U does not mention
the combination, not the same invention, and validly clam priority of DK-2 If EP2 can be
saved as disclosed above patent can be obtained for RI+G from EP2. Patent for the
triple combination RI+DI+G not possible but the patent protection for RI+G and RI+D
or for D or G would provide sufficient protection as would also stop 3rd parties from
making RI+DI+& But similarly PCT-DS if granted in EP can stop Copen from exploiting
RI+DI+G_ The combination Rl+D2 cannot be protected as not disclosed in any patent
application and was published on 05/02/2008 in the press release. But a patent
protection on G can stop others from making, selling, using RI+G_ But also a patent
protection on R or RI from PCT-DS can stop Copen from using RI+G_ The
combinations RI+DI and RI+G can be protected in DK through DKI, DK2 if not
possible via the EP applications, but if possible the EP applications confer longer
protection.
The publication of DK-U is state of the art 54(2) for EPI and EP2 regarding the
combinations It is not novelty destroying as discloses only RI not RI+DI or RI +G_
It can be relevant for the inventive step, however if Dl or G patentable its combination
with known RI should be also patentable. (based on an inventive step)
2.) Save applications EPI and EP2 as disclosed above by requesting
re-establishment of rights. Contact BEP explaining them that they should immediately
contact the EPO and inform about the situation in order to obtain interruption of
proceedings and once resumed complete the necessary acts immediately as disclosed
above. Once situation cleared acquire patent rights of EP-BEP and inform EPO about
the transfer by registering it with EPO
To have provisional protection for Dl and G in Europe applicant might request early
publication once applications saved as disclosed above.
If all above steps are successful later on the national applications can be abandoned to
save money.
3.) A European patent arising form PCT-DS if granted can be problematic as the
general claim on R could stop Copen Tennis from the exploitation of RI alone or in any
other combination with Dl, D2, G.
Additionally as tennis racket RI is already sold and PCT-DS already published the sales
can infringe the provisional protection conferred by PCT-DS, Euro-PCT-DS'
