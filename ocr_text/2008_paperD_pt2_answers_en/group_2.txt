c.) Racket dumper Dl
The racket dumper Dl is disclosed among the patent applications only in DKI and EPI _
EPI validly claims the priority of DKI with regard to Dl as the combination RI+DI was
first disclosed in it thus the claim relating to Dl has an effective date of 27/12/2006. (DK-
U discloses only RI but not DID
PCT-DS has an earlier effective date but does not disclose or mention a dumper, it is not
relevant
Further EP-BEP claiming priority of FR-BEP validly as the priority year of FR-BEP
expires on 03/09/2005 (Sunday) 04/09/2008 But EP-BEP was not published, so no
Art.54(3) effect Even if would be published were not relevant as discloses a different
dumper D2 and would be Alt54(3) prior art not relevant for inventive step. DK-Us
publication is state of the art but as discloses RI it is not relevant.
Thus from EPI a valid patent could be obtained for Dl_ But important pages missing
(page 3-4) from the description. If not present problem can arise as the disclosure is not
sufficient (Art.83D as so the invention is not patentable as cannot be carried out by
person skilled it the art EPI filed after 13/12/2007 thus EPC 2000 applies. Accordingly
new Rule 56 could be applied to insertion of the missing 2 pages is possible without
affecting the filing date. As the EPO sent no notification the time limit for this is 2 months
from filing i.e.: 15/02/2008 already expired. It can be remedied only with re-
establishment of rights if all due care can be provem It seems so as the cause was the
fire occurred on 21/12/2007 before the expiry of the 2 months.
Thus request for re-establishment has to be filed within 2 m. fr_ the removal of the cause
of the non-compliance: i.e fr 28/02/2008 2m. 28/04/2008 at the latest on 28/04/2008
paying the fee for re-establishment, completing the omitted act of R.56(2) and (3) thus
file missing pages, copy of the earlier application, the translation of the earlier (DKI)
application an indication where the missing parts of the description are in the earlier
application (DKI) and a request that the missing parts are based on the earlier
applicatiom
As EPI is a complete translation of DKI if request for re-establishment accepted the
request regarding the missing pans should be accepted without the change of filing
date. The request for re-establishment has to state the grounds and facts (fire and that
patent department was destroyed). As backup files were kept it supports all due care so
also request for re-establishment should be granted and thus EPI can be saved without
changing the filing date, maintaining the priority'
Dl is novel as not disclosed in any prior art document. Its inventive step seems to be
supported by the significant advantages through reducing the vibrations due to its
specific shape.
In Denmark DKI can confer protection for Dl if EPI cannot be saved. If EPI is saved
better to have protection in DK via EPI as it provides longer protection with â€” 1 year.
