1.) Legal situation of the inventions
a.) Sports racket R
The spons racket R was first disclosed in IN-DS filed on 10/12/2005. The application
PCT-DS validly claims the priority of IN-DS which was filed in a Paris Convention
country not more than 12 months earlier filed by the same applicant and discloses the
same subject-matter same invention. As PCT-DS entered the European phase validly
and no relevant prior art was cited in the EPOs search repoll a valid patent can be
obtained for R in Europe (as well is in other countries if the national phase/regional
phase will be staffed; 30 m. not expired yet' (expires on 10/06/2008)
The inventive step of the racket seems to be supported by the advantage of the racket
being light and stiff.
(Only EP-BEP claiming priority of FR-BEP dated 03/09/2005 has an earlier effective
date but as it relates to a dumper D2 it is not relevant for the inventive step as its
subject-matter is different and was not published but even when published would be
Art.54(3) prior art not relevant for the inventive step assessment)
b.) The tennis racket RI
It was first disclosed also in IN-DS whose priority is validly claimed in PCT-DS as
mentioned above. PCT-DS does not claim RI but the claim on R covers also RII As
PCT-DS is still pending in Europe DS might add new clams relating to RI as it would
not extend the scope of the application as filed because Dl is disclosed in the
description as an example, or DS can even file a divisional application for RI
(it would be more costly)
EPI and EP2 also claim RI but none of them is entitled to the priority of DK-I and DK-2
respectively as neither DK-I nor DK-2 is the first disclosure of RI as it was already
disclosed by the same applicant (Copen Tennis) in DK-IJ_ As DK-U was made publicly
available (published in April 2006) before filing DK-I and DK-2 Art.87(4) does not apply
(nor because DK-IJ has left rights outstanding as DK-I and DK-2 claim its priority!)
Thus as the claims in EPI and EP2 relating to RI have an effective date of 15/12/2007
and 14/11/2007 respectively, so later than the effective date of PCT-DS Copen cannot
obtain patent protection for RI in Europe as PCT-DS designating EP, published in
English and entered the European phase in all designated contracting states will be
Art.54(3) prior art for both EPI and EP2.
From EP2 however as it was filed before 13/12/2007 Art54(4) EPC 73 still applies and
PCT-DS will be prior art only in the commonly designated states. As PCT-DS designates
all contracting states it can be only Malta which could be designated in EP2 but not in
PCT-DS_ If EP2 can be saved protection for Malta for RI is possible.
Regarding DK-U a valid protection might be possible in DK depending on the national
requirements for utility models, but as PCT-DS has an earlier effective date it is
questionable. Additionally DK-U published before the effective date of RI in EPI and
EP2 is Art.54(2) prior art thus novelty destroying.
