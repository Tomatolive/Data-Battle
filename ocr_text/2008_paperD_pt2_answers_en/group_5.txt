But as the racket seems to be not really useable without the solution of Dl or D2:
i.e. without the damper as show annoyingly high vibrations when hitting the ball DS
needs to use the solution of Dl or D2_ Thus it is very imponant to acquire rights for D2 to
stop DS from using it which they intend according to the press release and also to save
EPI
Further as DS intends to use the grip G according to the press release our position is
fufther improved as if EP2 saved we can have a patent for it in Europe.
Thus neither the competitor DS nor Copen Tennis can produce the rackets without
infringing the other's patent rights in Europe which is of interest for Copen Tennis with
the exception of Malta where DS cannot have patent protection as Malta was neither
PCT nor EPC member state in 2006 when PCT-DS filed.
Thus it is suggested to negotiate with DS to obtan cross-licensing for Europe.
As Copen produces only tennis rackets a licence from DS is needed only for the tennis
rackets. However it seems that the claims on Dl and G are not restricted for tennis
rackets thus DS needs the licence for other rackets as well.
If by some reason EPI and EP2 cannot be saved Copen Tennis will be in a very bad
situation as DS will be able to use Dl and/or G in all European countries except DK.
Also if D2 not patented via EP-BEP and rights for this not acquired the use of Dl would
be circumvented by DS by the use of D2_
