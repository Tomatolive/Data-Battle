Yes, withdrawal of the priority claim is still possible as 30 months from priority date
not expired yet (16/06/2008 and today 04/03/2008 0K).
b) No, as because as detailed above the time limit for filing the demand
(R.54bis I(b) is 15/10/2007 22 months from priority date as it is later than 3 months
from receipt of the search report (30/04/2007) already expired and by the
withdrawal of the priority claim only those time limits are recomputed which are not
expired yet R_90bis 3(d).
Thus the withdrawal of the priority has no sense in order to file a demand.
As the demand is necessary in order to carry out an international preliminary
examination A_31(1) PCT.
