If you decide to pursue a new application under Article 61 (l)(b) EPC (as discussed in 2b
above) this new application can be allowed to lapse.
ii) TO protect the BLOWSAW development a new application or series Of applications
should be filed.
If the new process has a worldwide interest a PCT application could be filed, designating
the desired states, eg EP, US and JP. The application could be filed with the EPO as
receiving Office
Alternatively, national applications in the countries Of interest could be filed. A PCT
application has the advantage that only a single set of fees need be paid now and the
expense of filing nationally is delayed by 20 or 30 months (or 8 or 18 months if priority is
claimed).
A further option would be to file a single application such as a German application now
and file a PCT application within one year claiming proirity from the earlier application.
This has the advantage of providing one extra year of patent term.
The new application should be filed before the MULTISAW applications are published
(on or shortly after 29 May 2002) in order that these applications are citable for novelty
only and not for inventive step.
The new application should claim
(i) the improved process using BLOWSAW
(ii) a device incorporating BLOWSAW.
The computer program itself cannot be claimed as it is excluded under Article 52(2)(c)
EPC. Similar provisions apply in other States. However, the new process and device
using BLOWSAW have a technical effect (compensation for deviations in the cutting
line) and are therefore patentable.
The new application should be filed in the name of SILWAFE AG with the student who
developed the new process named as inventor. If a PCT application designating the US
is filed, the student must also be named as an applicant. This means that his signature
is required either on the PCT Request form or an authorisation (eg authorising me to
represent him).
However, if the student's signature cannot be obtained, we can still proceed with an
application in the US if we provide a statement to the receiving office explaining why we
cannot obtain his signature (Rule 4.15(b) PCT).
Prior art:
None Of the earlier applications discloses the BLOWSAW embodiment and none has yet
been published. There are therefore no applications relevant under Article 54(2) or (3)
EPC. As discussed above the meeting with ZÃ¤hnli and the tests carried out are
confidential and thus not part of the state of the art. The new application for BLOWSAW
therefore appears to be novel and inventive over the art.
