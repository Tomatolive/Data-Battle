la. Patent Situation for COOLMIX Applications
Pending applications exist in DE, JP, US and EP. Since the EP application claims all Of
the subject matter Of COOLMIX-DE and designates DE, COOL MIX-DE can be allowed
to lapse.
The priority claims of the EP, JP and US applications are all valid. A translation of the
priority application may be needed in JP and US in due course.
The certified copy of COOLMIX-DE can be filed with the EPO regarding COOLMIX-EP
up to 16 months from priority, thus by 29 March 2002 (extended to 2 April 2002 under
Rule 85(1 ) EPC). No further formalities are required to ensure the priority claim for
COOLMIX-EP.
The priority claim for COOLMIX-EP does not apply to the compositions containing a
surfactant since these were not mentioned in COOLMIX-DE (G 2/98).
Renewal fees for COOLMIX-EP are not due until 30 November 2002 (extended to
2 December 2002 under Rule 85(1 ) EPC). No communications have yet issued on any
of the four applications so the only necessary action is filing the certified copy of the
priority application for COOLMIX-EP, at present.
1b. Patentability Of COOL-MIX applications.
The only known prior art is CLEAN-PCT, since no search reports have yet issued.
CLEAN-PCT may form a prior right for the EP, JP and US applications since it currently
designates all states.
CLEAN-PCT will only be prior art against COOLMIX-EP under Article 54(3) EPC if it is
brought into the European regional phase. This requires a translation into English,
French or German to be filed and the national fee paid (Article 158(1 ) and (2) EPC).
Further, CLEAN-PCT will only be prior art in respect of states designated in both
CLEAN-PCT (and for which designation fees are paid) and COOLMIX-EP (Rule 23a
EPC)•
Where CLEAN-PCT is citable, it is relevant for novelty only and thus any overlap in
subject matter can be overcome by disclaiming the specific composition described in
CLEAN-PCT. The disclaimer will be allowable here since it overcomes only a novelty
citation (T 170187, T 426/94) and since a more concise wording of the claim whilst
retaining the same broad scope will not be possible (T 4/80).
Where CLEAN-PCT is not citable, no amendment need be made to COOLMIX-EP.
