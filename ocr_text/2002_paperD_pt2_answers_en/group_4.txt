MULTISAW-DE to the attention of Zähnli and the EPO. The EPO will allow Zähnli to file
an amended set of claims for Germany to account for this national prior right
(Rule 87 EPC).
However, Zähnli may obtain a valid patent in all other EP States.
If we were to file a new application in Europe now, CUT-PCT would not be considered
as prior art. CUT-PCT was filed as a result of an evident abuse under Article 55(1) EPC
Since Klug told Listig that worldwide commercialisation would only benefit our
competitors, Listig knew that harm would or could ensue from filing CUT-PCT
(T 585/92, OJ EPO 3/1996, 129, Guidelines c-IV, 8.3). Therefore, in accordance with
the Guidelines (C-IV, 8.3), if we file a new application before CUT-PCT is published (due
to take place on or after 20 June 2002), CUT-PCT will not prejudice our rights.
Thus we will be able to obtain a patent, but so will Zähnli. In order to use the MULTISAW
process, we will need a license from Zähnli and Zähnli would need one from us.
b) Alternatively, if you are happy to risk your business relations with Zähnli and to avoid
the awkward cross-licensing situation mentioned above, we could initiate proceedings
for non-entitlement against Zähnli. This should be done before the Swiss courts as this
is Zähnli's principle place of business (Art. 2, Protocol on Recognition). The decision will
be recognised in all EPC contracting states.
Once the EP regional phase is entered, we can request suspension Of proceedings on
CUT-PCT under Rule 13 EPC
The proceedings should result in a decision that SILWAFE is entitled to the MULTISAW
process, whilst Zähnli are entitled to continue with their application regarding the new
saw blade.
Our options at this stage would be either to request refusal of the aspects of CUT-PCT
relating to MULTISAW and to proceed with our own application as discussed above at
If this is done the new application should be filed now in order to obtain the earliest
possible date for the invention.
Altematively, we could file a new application based on CUT-PCT under Article 61 (1 )(b)
EPC. Zähnli could continue with their application only with regard to the new saw blade.
This option is preferable because it will obtain an earlier date for the new application (we
will be entitled to the date of filing CUT-PCT). Further, the description of CUT-PCT
seems to contain all of the subject matter in which we are interested. This is important
as our new application may not extend beyond the content of CUT-PCT as filed.
In this case, I would recommend filing our new application now. If the entitlement
proceedings are successful, the new application can be dropped, and we can file an
Article 61(1)(b) application instead.
