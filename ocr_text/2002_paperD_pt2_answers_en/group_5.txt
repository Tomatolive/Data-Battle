3a. Further steps to take regarding COOLMIX applications
In addition to the recommendations set out in la-c above, further action is needed to
protect the compositions containing surfactants, in the EP states.
Since COOLMIX-EP does not disclose compositions containing a surfactant in general,
but rather mentions only specific surfactants, it is not possible to add a broad claim to
COOLMIX-EP relating to a composition containing any surfactant (Article 123(2) EPC).
I therefore recommend filing an additional EP application, designating all desired states,
and claiming priority from COOLMIX-P_ The application should be filed as soon as
possible in order to gain the earliest possible date for aspects not entitled to priority (ie
for compositions Other than those mentioned in COOLMIX EP).
The priority claim is valid under Article 87(1) EPC since the first application disclosing
the use of surfactants was COOLMIX-EP which was filed less than 12 months ago.
SILWAFE AG are entitled to a patent to any novel and inventive claim since they
themselves realised that all surfactants were useful in cooling and cleaning, ie the
invention is not NIPPON SAWS which has be "stolen".
The new application should claim:
(i) — compositions containing a surfactant (any surfactant)
(ii) — use Of these compositoins as a cleaning agent; and
(iii) — use of these compositions as a cooling agent.
The only prior art we are aware Of is CLEAN-PCT. If CLEAN-PCT is brought into the EP
regional phase, it will be necessary to limit claims (i) and (ii) above by disclaiming the
composition disclosed in CLEAN-PCT, as discussed at (1b) above. In order that CLEAN-
PCT is not Article 54(2) EPC prior art which would also be suitable for inventive step, the
new case should be filed before 2 April 2002 when CLEAN-PCT is due to be published.
3b. Further steps to take with regard to MULTISAW applications
(i) To protect the MULTISAW process and device a new EP application should be filed
now, designating all states except DE (since a separate application exists in DE). The
new application should claim the MULTISAW device and process).
The effect Of CUT-PCT as prior art against this new application was discussed in 2
above.
There does not appear to be any further relevant prior art since none of the MULTISAW
applications has yet been published and none is citable under Article 54(3) EPC. The
meeting between Listig and Klug was, it appears confidential. All papers handed over
were marked "confidential" and the meeting related to a possible contract for work. Such
meetings are usually considered to be confidential even if an explicit confidentiality
agreement is not in place (T 830/90). Similarly, all testing carried out since January this
year was under contract and was confidential. Further possible prior art might be the
disclosure by Dr Bissig last week at the SEMITEC 2002 conference. However, Dr Bissig
indicated that the process was still a trade secret, so this disclosure is also implicitly
confidential and not part Of the state Of the art.
