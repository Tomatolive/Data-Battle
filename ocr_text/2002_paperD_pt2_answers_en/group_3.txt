Article 123(2) EPC (added matter) would be violated.
It is therefore important that MULTISAW-DE is retained in order that an early date is
obtained in Germany.
le. Patentability of pending MULTISAW applications:
The applications in DE, US and JP are entitled to the date of 29 November 2000. We
are not aware of any prior art and these three applications therefore appear to be
patentable. Since the new process is said to be revolutionary, it is likely that SILWAFE
AG would have been aware Of prior art, if there were any.
If) Summary of status of MULTISAW applications.
- Applications in DE, US and JP are pending and are, as far as we can tell, patentable
- No protection can be obtained from MULTISAW-EP. Further action as to how to protect
this aspect is discussed in section 3 below.
2. Options as to how proceed with Zåhnli AG.
It appears that Ing. Listig has obtained the idea for the MULTISAW process from the
meeting with Mr. Klug and Zähnli are therefore not entitled to a patent in respect of this
subject matter (Art. 60 EPC). Zähnli are however entitled to claim the special type of saw
blade.
a) If you wish to maintain good relations with Zähnli, you may not wish to challenge their
entitlement to CUT-PCT. In this case, no action need be taken at present.
Since MULTISAW-DE was filed before CUT-PCT. and our JP and US applications
validly claim priority from MULTISAW-DE, we are entitled to an earlier date than Zähnli
are for CUT-PCT in DE, US and JP.
Thus, in DE and JP, CUT-PCT will not be citable as prior art and we will be able to
obtain a valid patent. Zähnli will not be able to claim the MULTISAW process or device
in any resulting DE or JP patent since MULTISAW-DE and —JP will be prior art against
CUT-PCT in respect Of these states.
In the US, an interference will be declared which we should win since we were the first
to invent the MULTISAW process.
Thus in DE, JP and US, CUT-PCT is not damaging to our patents and Zähnli cannot
obtain their Own patents for the MULTISAW process and device
In the remaining European States there is, as far as we know, no prior art which is
citable against CUT-PCT, so Zähnli can obtain a patent here for the MULTISAW device
and process. It should also be noted that MULTISAW-DE will not be citable under Article
54(3) EPC against a European regional phase Of CUT-PCT since national prio rights are
not citable. However, under German national law MULTISAW-DE will be citable. To
attempt to avoid using national court proceedings to enforce the effect Of MULTISAW-
DE, we could file party observations during the CUT-PCT EP proceedings to bring
