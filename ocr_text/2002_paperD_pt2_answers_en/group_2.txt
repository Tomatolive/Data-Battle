It is noted that CLEAN-PCT relates to the use of the compositions in celaning but does
not disclose their use in cooling. Therefore a claim could be added to COOLMIX-EP
(and possibly also to COOLMIX-US and —JP, dependent on national law), relating to the
use of the compositions in cooling. This would not add matter as long as the intended
use of the composition were described in COOLMIX-EP (Article 123(2) EPC). The new
claim would be novel even if CLEAN-PCT is citable since the new use is not disclosed in
CLEAN-PCT (See G 2/88).
No amendment can be made, however until after receipt Of the search report. I would
not recommend limiting the claims in any way yet in the light of CLEAN-PCT. We should
instead wait until it is clear whether CLEAN-PCT has entered the EP regional phase.
JP: A similar situation applies here in that CLEAN-PCT will be relevant to the novelty of
COOL-MIX JP. For more details and for possible amendments we should seek local
advice from Japanese attorneys.
US: The entitlement to an invention in the US depends on who was the first to invent
rather than the first to file. If both applications continue to the US national phase, an
interference will be declared to determine who is entitled to the overlapping subject
matter. Since interference proceedings are very expensive, I would recommend either
negotiating with NIPPON SAWS KK to reach some agreement on who can claim the
composition, or simply deleting the composition in question from the claims, eg by
disclaimer as discussed above.
lc. Summary — status Of COOLMIX applications
- all cases are pending
- COOL-MIX DE can be allowed to lapse
- certified copy of COOLMIX-DE should be filed with EPO by 2 April 2002
- as far as we know, the claims are patentable except that a disclaimer to the
composition disclosed in CLEAN-PCT may be needed
- addition Of a use claim, at least to COOLMIX-EP, would be useful.
I would also recommend that we initiate a watch on CLEAN-PCT to determine whether it
enters the EP, JP and US regional Inational phases
I would also recommend that you write to the EPO to appoint me as the new
representative for COOLMIX-EP. We also need to file an authorisation since
representation has changed. This should be done immediately.
ld. Status of MULTISAW applications:
Applications are currently pending in DE, EP, US and JP. Priority was validly claimed
from MULTISAW-DE for the US and JP applications.
The error in filing the incorrect specification for MULTISAW-EP cannot be corrected
under Rule 88 EPC since it is not allowable to replace an entire specification (G 2/95).
Further, the content of a priority document cannot be used to show the intended content
Of an application (G 3/89). Since the specification filed does not refer to the MULTISAW
process, it will not be possible to amend the specification or add claims including this as
