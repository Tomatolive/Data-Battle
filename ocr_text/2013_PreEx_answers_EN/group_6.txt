Question 12
The stopper of claim II is at least paftly insened into the neck of a bottle so that the
bottle is plugged by the stopper; therefore, the subject-matter of claim II does not
cover a stopper when it is not in the neck of a bottle.
The stopper of the third embodiment of the application is described in
paragraphs [010] and [011]. The stopper comprises a body and a filter plate. The
straight air channel in the body does not exclude the presence of the filter plate 34
either at the end of the body, as shown in Fig. 2 or within the body as shown in
Fig. 3. Claim II relates to a stopper whenever it is inserted in the neck of a bottle.
The last sentence of paragraph [01 0] describes the advantage of the stopper of the
third embodiment which only applies when it is inserted into the bottle. Therefore,
claim II covers the stopper of the third embodiment of the application.
The randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels of Dl
cannot be regarded as a 'Straight air channel extending through the whole body".
The synthetic rubber is defined to be "more particularly" a material of the stopper,
i.e. it does not limit the scope of claim II.
neck of a bottle. The wording "when the stopper closes the bottle..." specifies the
stopper when in use, but does not limit the stopper itself.
The wording "the air channel extends through the whole bodyn includes partly
extending ar channels which are interconnected with each other so as to form at
least an air channel extending through the whole body as shown by the air
channels 103 of Dl _
The third embodiment of the stopper of the application is covered by the scope of
claim l, since the wording 'the air channel extends through the whole bodV' does
not exclude an interposed filter plate through which air can pass.
The synthetic rubber is specified to be only an example for the material of the
stopper, i.e. it does not limit the scope of claim l.

Question 13
The subject matter of claim Ill reads on to a stopper as shown in Fig. 1
The stopper of claim III is suitable for closing a bottle; therefore, the subject-matter
of claim III covers a stopper even when it is not in the neck of a bottle ("being
dimensioned.." is only a functional definition).
The term "continuously" implies paltly extending air channels which are
interconnected with each other so as to form at least a continuous air channel
extending through the whole body.
