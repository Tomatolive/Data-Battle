Question 16
In the context of the problem-solution approach, the technical effect is based on the
identified distinguishing feature of claim over D4 (Guidelines G-VII, 5.2). With a
straight air channel extending from the first planar sulface to the second planar
sulface, different rate of exchange of gasses by the stopper can be easily
determined by vary'lng the diameter of the straight air channel, see last sentences of
paragraphs [006] and [0081
The blind-hole of D4 is formed together with the foam body whereby the straight air
channel is not necessarily quicker to manufacture.
The gas permeability of the stopper is also dependent on the diameter of the air
channel, and not only on the gas permeability of the filter plate (see
paragraph [0008]).
There is no basis for drawing any conclusion with regard to the amount of material
used for making the stopper of claim V2 or for making the stopper of D4.

Question 17
In the context of the problem-solution approach, the objective technical problem
means the aim and task of modifying or adapting D4 to provide the technical effect
that the distinguishing feature of clam V3 provides over D4 (Guidelines G-VII, 5.2).
The distinguishing feature over D4 (the air channel is a through-hole extending
from the first planar surface to the second planar surface and that the filter unit is
attached to cover an end of the through-hole) provides the technical effect that gas
can pass only through the filter plate and the air channel. Hence, the rate of
exchange of gasses through the stopper can be more precisely determined by the
diameter of the air channel and the gas permeability of the filter plate. In view of
this, a valid definition of the objective technical problem is how to make a stopper
for a bottle having a predictable gas permeability (see paragraphs [0007] and
[0008]). Another more general definition is how to make a stopper for a bottle that
allows to better predict the maturation of the wine (paragraph [0003]), last
sentence).
Statement 172 is not related to the claimed distinguishing feature. For statement
IT3 it is noted that D4 is already air permeable without using cork, i.e. permeability
in general is not the problem to be solved.
