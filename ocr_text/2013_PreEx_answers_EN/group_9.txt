Question 18
The wording of A_V4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since
only synthetic rubber is disclosed in the application for all the embodiments.
The wording of B_V4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since
none of the embodiments comprises more than one filter plate.
The wording of C_V4 does not extend beyond the content of the application as
filed, since this wording is explicitly disclosed for liquids (paragraph [0008]) and the
stopper is for wine bottles (see paragraph [0001]) and wine as a specific liquid.
The wording of D.V4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since
the body itself of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 2 has no micro
perforations. The filter plate with the micro perforations is glued onto the body.

Question 19
The subject matter of claim VL is limited to the third embodiment of the application
shown in Fig. 3.
The argument given in statement 19.1 is irrelevant for the stated problem. However,
the statement 19.2 is valid as it demonstrates that D4 teaches a different solution
and that D2 does not suggest any alternative to gluing as taught in D4. Statement
19.3 is a valid argument, since the air channel of D3 is closed when the stopper is
inserted in the bottle, so that a filter plate is of no use. Statement 194 is incorrect,
since D4 already teaches the use of a plurality of air channels in the foam.

Question 20
The application does not explicitly disclose sparkling wine, which may have
different constraints on the stopper and the bottle
The application only discloses the specific synthetic rubber; "rubber includes also
the undisclosed natural rubber. In the wording "such as rubber" a preferable
undisclosed embodiment is unallowably introduced.
The term "element" generalizes the form of the filter plate, which has no basis in
the application.
The deletion of the wording is allowable, since it is redundant with the direction of
the flow of air already defined in the last three lines of claim VII.
