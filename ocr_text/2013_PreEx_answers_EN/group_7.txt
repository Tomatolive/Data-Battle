Question 14
The subject matter of claim IV is novel over Dl , since the body of Dl is made of
cork and does not comprise rubber.
The subject matter of claim IV lacks novelty over D2 The body of D2 comprises
rubber tube 202b (paragraph [004]). The air channel is provided by the core of D2
made of cork When the stopper of D2 closes a bottle, air can pass between the
interior and the exterior of the bottle, see paragraph [003].
The subject matter of claim IV is novel over D3, since as shown in Fig. 2 of D3 air
can not pass through the hole 303 when the stopper of D3 is inserted in the bottle
D3 discloses a stopper comprising a body and an air channel extending through
the body, since as shown in Fig. 1 of D3 air can pass through the hole 303 when
the stopper of D3 is not inserted in the bottle
The third embodiment of the stopper of the application is not covered by the scope
of claim III, since the stopper is defined to consist (see Guidelines, F-IV 4.21) of a
liquid-impermeable and air-impermeable rubber body which excludes the presence
of the filter plate.
No specific rubber is defined for the stopper, i.e. a synthetic rubber is not a feature
defined in claim Ill.

Question 15
The subject matter of claim VI is limited to the second embodiment of the
application shown in Fig. 2.
The subject matter of claim VI is novel over any of Dl to D3, since none of these
documents discloses a filtering unit.
The filter plate 404 of D4 is a specific form of the more generalised filtering unit, i.e.
the stopper of D4 has a filtering unit
