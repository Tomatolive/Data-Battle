We have looked into the matter and found the following:
We have developed together with a Japanese research institution JU the same
technology as Swedishfish (SF).
We filed a PCT application (PCTJU) and an EP application (EP4) with JU as
co-applicant for both applications.
The two applications were filed on the same day in May 2007, at the EPO for EP4 and at
the Japan Patent Office for PCTJU, both without claiming priority, and both designating
all possible states.
Both applications were published in November 2008
JU was in charge of the prosecution of PCTJU filed in Japanese and we were
responsible for prosecuting EP4_
The content of the nvo applications was almost the same, disclosing and claiming fish
farm nets made of materials belonging to class G.
The description of PCTJU was more detailed and described the use of the known
material M, which belongs to class G, for making fish farm nets.
JU informed us in February 2010 that, as they were no longer interested in this kind of
technology, they would be happy to transfer their patent rights to us if we wanted to
continue alone with the prosecution of the patent applications.
We have not replied to this offer
We have seen from the European Patent Register that the PCTJU application was
deemed to be withdrawn at the EPO according to a communication dated
4 January 2010 because none of the requirements for entering the regional phase was
fulfilled.
The search report of EPF cites only EP4, and during the examination of EPF before the
EPO only EP4 was mentioned by the examiner.
Nevertheless, for reasons that we do not understand, EPF was granted.
Last week we also received a communication according to Rule 71(3) EPC for EP4.
3) Can we help Nonnayfish (NF) in their conflict with Swedishfish (SF)?
4) Can patent rights be used against Swedishfish (SF)Q
