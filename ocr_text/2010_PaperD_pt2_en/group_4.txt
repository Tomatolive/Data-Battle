Then on 1 March 2009 we filed a new European patent application EP2 without claiming
priority. The description of EP2 includes the complete description of EPI as pages 1 to 5
and adds pages 6 to 10, which disclose the new electronic filter Fl on pages 6 to 9 and
the new circuit Cl on page 10. We mentioned in the description that the final new
circuit Cl is so compact that it can be included in an underwater camera
EP2 includes the following claims: the structure of the signal as clam 1 (same claim 1 as
in EPI), the filter Fl as claim 2 and the circuit Cl as claim 3
In September 2009, we received the European search report with one document cited
as "A" and a positive European Search Opinion for EPI , which is apparently ready for
grant
Also in September 2009, KM received the European search report for EPKM, with the
same document cited as "R and a positive European Search Opinion. The search report
and the accompanying opinion are available on KM'S public Internet site.
EPKM also appears to be ready for grant.
In November 2009, we received the European search report for EP2. The same
"R document was cited but the accompanying opinion was partly negative because the
EPO examner stated - and, according to our technical department, he was right - that
the disclosed circuit Cl could not produce any signal. In fact we had failed to describe
an essential and inventive electrical connection in circuit Cl between filter Fl and
standard circuit C. According to the examiner, claim 1 and claim 2 are allowable.
