On 20 January 2009, we hosted a public conference attended by KM where we
presented a video showing the effectiveness of this signal for attracting adult fish in
order to photograph them. However, we did not disclose the characteristics of the signal,
but we mentioned the application number EP 09123456 of EPI _
On 11 February 2009, we were very' surprised to read on the KM public Internet site that
on 10 Februa1Y 2009, KM had filed at the EPO a European patent application, EPKM,
without claiming priority. The content of EPKM was published on the KM public Intemet
site. The following statement in the description of EPKM shocked us: "The new signal
developed by KA and explained in European patent application number EP09123456
(corresponding to EPI) filed on 12 January 2009 allows a new fishing method which
permits a better regulation of fish stocks." The only claim of EPKM reads: "Fishing
method characterised by use of an electromagnetic signal attracting only adult fish in a
coastal region, said signal being emitted by transmitters integrated into a fishing net"
We asked KM for an explanation and they replied that they had the idea of developing
such a fishing method. The combination of a fishing net and transmitters is, without
doubt, new and inventive.
We also invented a new electronic filter Fl for producing the signal disclosed in EPII
this filter being so small that it can be connected to the standard electronic circuit C of an
undemater camera The new circuit Cl, which is constituted by the combination of
Fl and C, can still be incorporated into a standard undervvater camera.
