We then filed on 12 January 2010 a new European patent application EP3, as usual
without claiming priority, by adding to the description of EP2 pages 11 and 12, which
describe the essential and inventive electrical connection in Cl between the filter Fl and
the standard circuit C. The circuit claim, claim 3, was modified accordingly.
At the beginning of every year, KA makes a report which includes a summary of the
research carried out during the previous year and we annex to this report a copy of our
most interesting patent application. This year we decided to annex a copy of EP3
While preparing the report, we realised we had forgotten to file pages 6 to g of the
description of EP3, which concern the new filter Fl The report, however, includes the
complete version of EP3 with all pages 1 to 12 of the description as well as the claims.
The report was first made accessible at the end of January' 2010 in our public libraiY but
nobody has consulted it so far.
We will send the report to our principal sponsors at the end of March 2010.
On 2 February 2010, we transmitted the missing pages 6 to 9 to the EPO in order to
correct EP3_
On 19 February 2010, we received a communication according to Rule 56 EPC dated
17 February 2010 notifying us that the filing date of EP3 had been changed to
2 February 2010.
We are not interested in having a patent for a fishing method and we do not want KM or
anyone else to have a patent for the fishing method disclosed in EPKM_
1) This is our main concern. How can we achieve this objective?
2) Keeping our main concern in mind, how can we improve our patent situation in
Europe?
