You are a European patent attorney and this morning you received the following letter.
We, KA (Knowledge for All), are a research institution based in Scotland and we are
very active in developing new methods, systems and apparatuses used in marine
biology and diving.
We have contact with KM (Knowledge is Money), a Swedish research laboratoy, which
is doing research in a similar field.
On 12 January 2009, we filed at the EPO, without claiming priority, a European patent
application EPI for a new and revolutionary electromagnetic signal which attracts fish
and thereby allows divers to photograph them. Such an electromagnetic signal attracts
only adult fish, which are the most colourful ones. It works only in coastal regions.
EPI discloses the structure of the signal as well as a way of producing it using
conventional apparatuses and gives examples to prove that this signal really is effective
for attracting adult fish. EPI only discloses the use of the signal for underwater
photography. EPI includes only one claim defining the structure of the new signal,
i.e the amplitudes and frequencies of the different components of the signal.
