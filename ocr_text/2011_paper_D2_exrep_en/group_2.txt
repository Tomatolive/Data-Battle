A majority of candidates recognised that both JP-PANI and JP-PAN2 were prior art
against PCT-Ax, regardless of its effective date, and destroyed the novelty of its first three
claims (claim 3 only by JP-PAN2). The lubricating composition in the claims of PCT-Ax
was disclosed in both JP-PANI and JP-PAN2 since it involved a one fold selection from a
short list.
Most of the candidates recognised that claim 4, directed to the cross-shaped cross-section,
was novel and inventive and based their justification on the radical depanure from the prior
art and/or the technical advantages.
Regarding the payment of the additional search fee for claim 4, most of the candidates
were familiar with the regulations concerning deposit accounts, although some candidates
missed the fact that the administrative fee of 30% surcharge was not paid and there was
no way to have a valid payment of the search fee. More than a few candidates used EPC
provisions for calculating time limits instead of those of the PCT. For instance, the 10-day
rule under the EPC should not have been applied since PCT-Ax was still in the
international phase.
On the other hand, many candidates correctly proposed the filing of a divisional application
related to the subject matter of clam 4 upon entry of PCT-Ax into the European regional
phase.
Question 2
Many candidates recognised the validity of the priority claim from JP-PANI in EP-PANI
and drew the correct conclusions about what patent protection Pankutaya could obtain,
namely the axle unit with the special seal S. Most of the candidates also recognised that
Axbruch - despite a patent they could get for cross-shaped cross-section - would still not
be free to use it because of Pankutaya's EP-PANI
Most of the candidates spotted the imponance of the patent Axbruch could get on the
cross-shaped cross section of the axle as it was accepted to be the standard.
Question 3
Those candidates who recognised the invalidity of the disclaimer also saw the need to
appeal in order to remove it. However, many candidates answered that Axbruch should
appeal without giving full reasoning. For instance, some candidates only cited the case law
stating that a proprietor being a party as of right in appeal proceedings was limited to
defending the patent as amended by the opposition division.
Question 4
Some candidates appreciated that the only type of brakes disclosed in the application
documents of EP-Ax was the disc brakes and the claim the client could obtain was to a
bicycle brake system with the brake lever and disc brakes.
