anti-foaming agent The combination of a silicon oil with a viscosity index improver is a
one-fold selection from a single list, so that this combination is disclosed in each of
JPU-PANI , JPU-PAN2 and EP-PANI
It follows that the subject-matter of claims 1 and 2 of PCT-Ax is not new.
The axle ends described in JPU-PANI and EP-PANI are triangular in cross-section, so
that the subject-matter of clams 3 and 4 of PCT-Ax is not disclosed in JPIJ-PANI or
EP-PANI_ However, JPIJ-PAN2 further discloses that the axle has a pentagonal cross-
section at each end. Therefore, JPIJ-PAN2 discloses the subject-matter of claim 3 of
PCT-Ax, but not the cross-shaped axle ends that are the subject of claim
The cross-shaped axle ends are new. They are also seen as a radical departure from the
normal square shape and have technical advantages over the pentagonal and triangular
ones These are indications that the subject-matter of claim 4 of PCT-Ax is inventive
The EPO has issued an invitation to pay an additional search fee within one month of
23 January 201 1 _ This time period expired on 23 February 2011, so that the fee cannot
now be validly paid. Because the shortfall in the deposit account was made up on
24 February 2011, the deemed date of payment is 24 February 2011, which is outside the
time period set.
The sh01tfaIl in the deposit account was notified by fax on 26 January 2011. For the
payment to have been considered made on time, the account should have been
replenished and an additional surcharge of 30 % paid. The time period for doing so
expired on 26 February 2011, camed over to 28 February 2011. The account was
replenished in due time. However, the surcharge was not paid in due time, because no
debit order to this effect was filed. Therefore, the International Search Report will not
cover the subject-matter of claim 4.
There are no remedies available in the international phase for missing the time period for
payment of the additional search fee.
Because the EPO was the International Searching Authority, no supplementary search will
be performed on entry into the regional phase before the EPO The EPO Will request that
the applicant limit the application to one invention covered by the International Search
Report, so that an amendment to make claim 4 an independent claim will not be possible.
Axbruch will have to enter the regional phase and then file a divisional patent application
directed to the subject-matter of clam 4.
Axbruch could possibly file another divisional patent application with a second non-medical
use claim to the use of a combination of a silicon oil and a viscosity index improver to
prolong the lifespan of an axle unit including a seal S.
Answer to question 2:
Please analyse whether Pankutaya could obtain valid patent protection that would
pose a threat to our European activities.
EP-PANI claims an axle unit with a seal corresponding to Axbruch's seal S EP-PANI
claims priority of JPIJ-PANI, which has a filing date of 15 July 2009 There are no earlier
disclosures, because JPU-PAN2 was published later JPIJ-PAN2 has an earlier filing date
than JPU-PANI , however. JPU-PAN2 also discloses an axle unit with a seal
corresponding to Axbruch's seal S. However, JPU-PANI and JPU-PAN2 have different
applicants. Therefore, JPU-PANI is a first application. Because EP-PANI was filed by
reference to JPU-PANI , there is identity of contents. EP-PANI was filed 1 July 2010,
therefore within 12 months of the filing date of JPIJ-PANT It follows that the priority claim
-4-
