Examiners' Report Paper D 2011 - Part II
It is well-established that Part II of Paper D requires the candidates to first analyze a
situation involving various inventions, applications and patents and based on this analysis
to provide advice to a client on actions to take in the form of answers to specific questions.
The main issues the candidates were expected to recognise in this year's paper were:
- The claims of PCT-Ax were not entitled to the priority of DE-Ax_ DE-Ax did not disclose
the specific lubricating composition comprising a combination of a silicon oil and a
viscosity improver, present in all claims of PCT-Ax. Instead, it disclosed that the
lubricating composition comprised an oil to be selected from a long list of oils and at
least one additive to be also chosen from a list of additives The lubricant composition in
PCT-Ax was, thus, a selection from two lists of a certain length and could not be
considered to have been disclosed in DE-Ax_
- The priority claim from JP-PANI in EP-PANI was valid because JP-PANI and JP-PAN2
were filed by different applicants (Pankutaya Nederland BV and Pankutaya Japan KK
respectively). Hence, despite the fact that JP-PAN2 related to the same invention and
was filed before JP- PAN 1 i the latter was still the first application for Pankutaya
Nederland BV which was the applicant of EP-PANI
- The disclaimer in EP-Ax was invalid. The disclaimer was an undisclosed disclaimer
because there was no distinction in EP-Ax between mechanical and hydraulic brakes. It
did not fulfil the requirements set in GOI /03 for several reasons: it disclaimed more than
necessary to restore novelty (as brake systems with hydraulic disc brakes were not
disclosed in EP-PAN2); it was not necessary to restore novelty because the
embodiment in EP-PAN2 was not an enabling disclosure and could not be part of the
state of the art; it disclaimed a non-working embodiment, so it was also relevant for
sufficiency of disclosure.
Candidates are encouraged to verify their calculations of time limits in order to avoid
arriving at wrong dates and at a distorted view of the current situation.
Regarding the specific questions:
Question 1
Most of the candidates realised that PCT-Ax was filed within the priority year of DE-Ax
since the time limit was extended due to an official holiday of the EPO Some candidates
recognised that the claims of PCT-Ax were not entitled to the priority of DE-Ax and saw the
need to add a priority claim of USP-Ax in view of the disclosure to the standardisation
committee.
It was generally well-recognised that it was still possible to add a priority claim from
IJSP-Ax since the four months from the filing date of PCT-Ax had not yet expired, although
some candidates referred to the 16 months from priority date starting - wrongly - from the
priority to be added (USP-Ax) and not from the earlier priority date (DE-Ax)_
