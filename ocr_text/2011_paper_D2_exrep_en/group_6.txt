disclaimer, because that would broaden the scope of protection, i.e. contravene the
principle of no Reformatio in Peius (G 4/93). It follows that Axbruch must appeal.
Since the appeal has suspensive effect, the opposition proceedings are still pending. For
completeness, it is noted that Axbruch cannot initiate limitation proceedings to limit the
granted patent by an amendment that does not include the disclamer_ They cannot wait
until the appeal is disposed of either, because then the patent they would apply to limit
would include the disclamer, and its removal would not be a limitation, but an extension.
Answer to question 4:
Discuss what subject-matter we could validly claim to obtain the broadest scope of
protection possible.
If Axbruch appeal, they cannot revert to the independent claim of the patent as granted,
which was directed to the brake lever. This claim lacks novelty, because there is sufficient
information in EP-PAN2 to make the brake lever EP-PAN2 merely does not provide
sufficient information to make a functioning bicycle brake system.
A claim to a bicycle brake system comprising the brake lever would encompass a limited
number of alternative brake systems (four) of which one is not enabled, namely the bicycle
brake system with the newly developed brake lever and a hydraulic rim brake. It is
therefore arguable that a claim to a bicycle brake system comprising the brake lever would
not be enabled.
The broadest protection Axbruch could certainly get would be in the form of an
independent clam to a bicycle brake system wth the brake lever and disc brakes. Also
possible in principle would be a claim to a set of parts for use in assembling a bicycle
brake system, comprising the brake lever and disc brakes.
