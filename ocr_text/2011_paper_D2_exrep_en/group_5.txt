of EP-PANI is valid. Therefore, there is no benefit in filing JPIJ-PAN2 as third party
observations.
Pankutaya can obtain a valid European patent to an axle unit with a seal corresponding to
the seal S. Such a patent would cover the axle unit that Axbruch GmbH intends to
manufacture, so that they would infringe. Axbruch GmbH will need to take a licence from
Pankutaya
The European patent directed to the subject-matter of claim 4 of PCT-Ax that Axbruch
GmbH could obtain would be a dependent patent relative to EP-PANI. Axbruch's patent
is very likely to become essential to the new standard, so that Pankutaya would be
interested in negotiating a cross-licence agreement
EP-PANI is a pending European patent application. It is not a divisional of an earlier
European patent application. There are no indications that examination has been
requested, let alone that a first communication from the Examination Division been issued.
Therefore, Pankutaya could still file a European divisional patent application based on
Answer to question 3:
Should we appeal?
Axbruch GmbH is entitled to appeal, because it is adversely affected by the decision of the
Opposition Division (i.e. the decision not to allow the main request).
The ground of insufficiency introduced by Pankutaya is a fresh ground of opposition. It will
not be considered if Axbruch were to object to its introduction. Since the statement of
grounds of appeal must contain a party's complete case, dismissal of the only ground of
appeal might well be the end of the appeal. However, this would not be in Axbruch's
interests.
EP-Ax only discloses disc brakes. It does not make a distinction between mechanical and
hydraulic brakes. Therefore, the disclaimer added in the opposition proceedings was an
undisclosed disclaimer in the sense of G 1/03
The disclaimer is invalid for any one of the following reasons:
1) It arguably disclaims more than is necessary to restore novelty over EP-PAN2,
because It disclaims also all bicycle brake systems with hydraulic disc brakes, but such a
bicycle brake system is not disclosed in EP-PAN2_
2) It is not necessary to restore novelty, because the disclosure of EP-PAN2 is not an
enabling disclosure.
3) It has become relevant to the issue of sufficiency of disclosure, because it disclams a
bicycle brake system that does not work.
To obtain a valid patent, the disclaimer should be removed.
If Axbruch do not file an appeal, then they would have to defend the patent as maintained
in opposition proceedings. As a party as of right, they could then not remove the
