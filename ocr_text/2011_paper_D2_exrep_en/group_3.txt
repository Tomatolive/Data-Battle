Possible solution - Paper D 2011
Answer to question 1:
- Part II
For which aspects of our development can we obtain patent protection in Europe,
and how?
PCT-Ax is Axbruch's only pending patent application that could conceivably lead to
protection in Europe, as DE-Ax is no longer pending.
The priority period commencing with the filing of USP-Ax expired on 1 February 2011
Although the time window for filing a new European or international patent application in
combination with a request for re-establishment of rights into the priority period or
restoration of the priority right respectively is still open, there are no grounds on which
such a request could be based.
PCT-Ax clams priority of DE-Ak DE-Ax has a filing date of 30 October 2009. PCT-Ax was
filed in time to claim priority of DE-Ax, because 30 October 2010 is a Saturday and 1
November 2010 is All Saints ' Day, which is a day on which the EPO (Munich) as the
Receiving Office was closed. Axbruch GmbH was applicant for DE-Ax, and is applicant for
PCT-Ax for all states except for the IJ_S_ From a formal point of view, the requirements for
a valid priority claim are met
DE-Ax discloses an axle unit with the special seal S and the nvo axle variants. It also
discloses that the axle unit contains a lubricating composition of which the oil can be
chosen from one long list of suitable oils and an additive from another list of suitable
additives. However, all claims of PCT-Ax include the feature "silicon oil and a viscosity
improver". This is a selection from the two lists, namely the list of Oils and the list of
additives, given in DE-Ak Therefore, DE-Ax does not disclose the invention claimed in
PCT-Ax, and the claims of PCT-Ax are not entitled to the priority date of DE-Ak As things
stand, the effective date of all claims is the filing date of PCT-Ax (2 November 2010).
The submission of the complete description of the two axle unit variants to the
standardisation committee amounts to a public disclosure. Because the disclosure to the
standardisation committee discloses all the subject-matter of PCT-Ax, it is essential that
the claims of PCT-Ax have an effective date prior to 2 February 2010
A claim to priority of USP-Ax in PCT-Ax should be added. At the filing date of PCT-Ax,
IJSP-Ax stood in the name of Axbruch GmbH, following an assignment from the inventors.
Therefore, the applicants for USP-Ax and PCT-Ax were the same at the filing date of
PCT-Ax. A clam to priority may be added until 16 months from the earliest priority date,
but in any case within 4 months from the filing date of PCT-Ak The 16-months period
expired on 28 February 2011. However, the 4-months period expires on 2 March 2011
Therefore, a request to add a claim to priority of USP-Ax should be filed tomorrow at the
latest. This request can be filed with the 1B or with the EPO as Receiving Office. USP-Ax
is Axbruch's first application to disclose in detail the two axle units that Axbruch has
developed in combination with the lubricant compositiom The subject-matter of all clams
of PCT-Ax is therefore disclosed in IJSP-Ax, so that all claims of PCT-Ax would be entitled
to the date of filing of USP-Ax and would have 1 February 2010 as their effective date.
JPU-PANI and JPU-PAN2 were published before the effective date of all the claims of
PCT-Ax. EP-PANI is prior aft under Art. 54(3) EPC Each of JPIJ-PANI, JPIJ-PAN2 and
EP-PANI discloses an axle unit with a seal corresponding to the seal S developed by
Axbruch and with an axle decreasing in diameter towards each end. JPU-PANI
JPU-PAN2 and EP-PANI additionally describe that the lubricant composition is a silicon oil
in combination with an additive that may be a viscosity index improver, an emulsifier or an
